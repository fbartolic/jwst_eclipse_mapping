Observations cover the period from the end of 2008 to mid 2015, with an approximately monthly cadence. Emission lines have been identified and measured in the spectra, which permits us to classify the sources into BL Lac-type or FSRQs, according to the commonly used EW limit. We have obtained synthetic photometry and produced colour-magnitude diagrams which show different trends associated with the object classes: generally, BL Lacs tend to become bluer when brighter and FSRQs become redder when brighter, although several objects exhibit both trends, depending on brightness. We have also applied a pattern recognition algorithm to obtain the minimum number of physical components which can explain the variability of the optical spectrum. We have used NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) instead of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to avoid un-realistic negative components. For most targets we found that 2 or 3 meta-components are enough to explain the observed spectral variability.},

  abstract = {We present a uniform assessment of existing near-infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations of planet-bearing stars. Using a simple four-parameter blackbody thermal model, we analyze stars for which photometry in at least one of Spitzer's IRAC bands has been obtained over either the entirety or a significant fraction of the planetary orbit. Systems in this category comprise 10 well-studied systems with hot Jupiters on circular or near-circular orbits (HAT-P-7, HD 149026, HD 189733, HD 209458, WASP-12, WASP-14, WASP-18, WASP-19, WASP-33, and WASP-43), as well as three stars harboring planets on significantly eccentric orbits (GJ 436, HAT-P-2, and HD 80606). We find that our simple model, in almost all cases, accurately reproduces the minimum and maximum planetary emission, as well as the phase offsets of these extrema with respect to transits/secondary eclipses. For one notable exception, WASP-12 b, adding an additional parameter to account for its tidal distortion is not sufficient to reproduce its photometric features. Full-orbit photometry is available in multiple wavelengths for 10 planets. We find that the returned parameter values for independent fits to each band are largely in agreement. However, disagreements in nightside temperature suggest distinct atmospheric layers, each with their own characteristic minimum temperature. In addition, a diversity in albedos suggests variation in the opacity of the photospheres. While previous works have pointed out trends in photometric features based on system properties, we cannot conclusively identify analogous trends for physical model parameters. To make the connection between full-phase data and physical models more robust, a higher signal-to-noise ratio must come from both increased resolution and a careful treatment of instrumental systematics.},

  abstract = {Recent work suggests that many short-period extrasolar planets may have spin obliquities that are significantly tilted with respect to their orbital planes. These large obliquities are a natural outcome of ``secular spin\textendash orbit resonance,'' a configuration in which the planetary spin precession frequency matches the frequency of orbit nodal regression, or a Fourier component thereof. While exoplanet spin obliquities have not yet been measured directly, they may be detectable indirectly through their signatures in various observations, such as photometric measurements across the full phase of a planet's orbit. In this work, we employ a thermal radiative model to explore how large polar tilts affect full-phase light curves, and we discuss the range of unique signatures that are expected to result. We show that the well-studied short-period planets HD 149026b, WASP-12b, and CoRoT-2b all exhibit phase curve features that may arise from being in high-obliquity states. We also constrain the parameters and assess the detectability of hypothetical perturbing planets that could maintain the planets in these states. Among the three planets considered, CoRoT-2b has the tightest constraints on its proposed obliquity (45\textdegree. 8 {$\pm$} 1\textdegree. 4) and axial orientation. For HD 149026b, we find no significant evidence for a nonzero obliquity, and the phase curve of WASP-12b is too complicated by strong tidal distortions for a conclusive assessment.},

  abstract = {Mapping exoplanets across phases and during secondary eclipse is a powerful technique for characterizing Hot Jupiters in emission. Since these planets are expected to rotate about axes normal to their orbital planes, with rotation periods synchronized with their orbital periods, mapping provides a direct correspondence between orbital phase and planetary longitude. For planets with fewer constraints on their spin properties, the relationship between the shape of the eclipse light curve and the visible portion of the surface is more complex. We develop a framework to understand the information content of planets where the rotation rate and/or axis orientation are not well constrained, by constructing a basis of emission time series ("light curves") that are orthogonal in integrated flux across secondary eclipse. The most orthogonal bases in eclipse consist of periodic functions - akin to sinusoids - and at slow enough rotation rates these follow a monotonic series in frequency. If only data during eclipse are considered, we show that very similar light curves at a given frequency can be generated by maps of similar complexity at a wide range of spin axis orientations. Constraining spin axis orientations from eclipse data alone may therefore depend on strong prior knowledge of plausible emission map structures and/or rotation rates. When the planetary rotation period becomes shorter than the total eclipse duration, there will be an additional ambiguity between the complexity of the emission map and observable variations due to rotation, as both can in principle generate similar signals. By modeling example eclipse observations of the Warm Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we demonstrate that the available signal-to-noise for \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ orbits is just sufficient to derive map structure beyond the eclipse depth.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery of a highly irradiated and moderately inflated ultra-hot Jupiter, TOI-1431b/MASCARA-5b (HD 201033b), first detected by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission (TESS) and the Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA). The signal was established to be of planetary origin through radial velocity measurements obtained using SONG, SOPHIE, FIES, NRES, and EXPRES, which show a reflex motion of \$K=294.1\textbackslash pm1.1\$ m s\$\^\{-1\}\$. A joint analysis of the TESS and ground-based photometry and radial velocity measurements reveals that TOI-1431b has a mass of \$M\_\{p\}=3.12\textbackslash pm0.18\$ \$\textbackslash rm\{M\_J\}\$ (\$990\textbackslash pm60\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$), an inflated radius of \$R\_\{p\}=1.49\textbackslash pm0.05\$ \$\textbackslash rm\{R\_J\}\$ (\$16.7\textbackslash pm0.6\$ R\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$), and an orbital period of \$P=2.650237\textbackslash pm0.000003\$ d. Analysis of the spectral energy distribution of the host star reveals that the planet orbits a bright (\$\textbackslash mathrm\{V\}=8.049\$ mag) and young (\$0.29\^\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.19\}\$ Gyr) Am type star with \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=7690\^\{+400\}\_\{-250\}\$ \$\textbackslash rm\{K\}\$, resulting in a highly irradiated planet with an incident flux of \$\textbackslash langle F \textbackslash rangle=7.24\^\{+0.68\}\_\{-0.64\}\textbackslash times\$10\$\^9\$ erg s\$\^\{-1\}\$ cm\$\^\{-2\}\$ (\$5300\^\{+500\}\_\{-470\}\textbackslash mathrm\{S\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\}\$) and an equilibrium temperature of \$T\_\{eq\}=2370\textbackslash pm70\$ K. TESS photometry also reveals a secondary eclipse with a depth of \$127\^\{+4\}\_\{-5\}\$ppm as well as the full phase curve of the planet's thermal emission in the red-optical. This has allowed us to measure the dayside and nightside temperature of its atmosphere as \$T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{day\}=3004\textbackslash pm64\$ K and \$T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{night\}=2583\textbackslash pm63\$ K, the second hottest measured nightside temperature. The planet's low day/night temperature contrast (\$\textbackslash sim\$420 K) suggests very efficient heat transport between the dayside and nightside hemispheres.},

  abstract = {One of the primary questions when characterizing Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized exoplanets is whether they have a substantial atmosphere like Earth and Venus or a bare-rock surface like Mercury. Phase curves of the planets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a substantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock surface. Analyzing phase-curve photometric data around secondary eclipses has previously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the thermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We utilize a semianalytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared photometric data at 4.5 {$\mu$}m. The model uses parameters of planetary properties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio between radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and the atmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by thermal emission with an eastward-shifted hotspot. We determine the heat redistribution efficiency to be 1.47-+00..2350, which implies that the advective timescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement cannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by currents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the scenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat redistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of {$\sim$}1.4 bar. The Spitzer 4.5 {$\mu$}m band is thus a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet 55 Cancri e.},

Some initial studies suggested that since the planet is so close to its host star, it receives enough insolation to partially melt its surface. However, these past studies failed to take into consideration the role that tides may play in this system. Even if the planet's eccentricity has always been zero, we show that tidal decay of the semimajor axis could have been large enough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation. Moreover, CoRoT-7b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates its geophysics and drives extreme volcanism. In this case, CoRoT-7b is a ``super-Io'' that, like Jupiter's volcanic moon, is dominated by volcanism and rapid resurfacing. Such heating could occur with an eccentricity of just 10-5. This small value could be driven by CoRoT-7c if its own eccentricity is larger than {$\sim$}10-4. CoRoT-7b may be the first of a class of planetary super-Ios likely to be revealed by the CoRoT and Kepler spacecraft.},

  abstract = {CoRoT-7b, a planet about 70\% larger than the Earth orbiting a Sun-like star, is the first-discovered rocky exoplanet, and hence has been dubbed a ``super-Earth.'' Some initial studies suggested that since the planet is so close to its host star, it receives enough insolation to partially melt its surface. However, these past studies failed to take into consideration the role that tides may play in this system. Even if the planet's eccentricity has always been zero, we show that tidal decay of the semimajor axis could have been large enough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation. Moreover, CoRoT-7b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates its geophysics and drives extreme volcanism. In this case, CoRoT-7b is a ``super-Io'' that, like Jupiter's volcanic moon, is dominated by volcanism and rapid resurfacing. Such heating could occur with an eccentricity of just 10\textendash 5. This small value could be driven by CoRoT-7c if its own eccentricity is larger than {$\sim$}10\textendash 4. CoRoT-7b may be the first of a class of planetary super-Ios likely to be revealed by the CoRoT and Kepler spacecraft.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of wt\% of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. In order to understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present magmoc, a versatile magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma ocean-atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth-oceans. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f and g most likely followed the extremely wet scenario with a prolonged magma ocean phase of at least 250 Myr. Planet e probably followed the dry or intermediate track, and may or may not have possessed little water vapour or oxygen in the atmosphere at the time of mantle solidification. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3-5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

  abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presents the opportunity to transform our understanding of planets and the origins of life by revealing the atmospheric compositions, structures, and dynamics of transiting exoplanets in unprecedented detail. However, the high-precision, time-series observations required for such investigations have unique technical challenges, and prior experience with other facilities indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST becomes operational. In this paper we describe the science objectives and detailed plans of the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which is a recently approved program for JWST observations early in Cycle 1. The goal of this project, for which the obtained data will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the acquisition and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting exoplanet observations with JWST, while also providing a compelling set of representative datasets that will enable immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet Community ERS Program will exercise the time-series modes of all four JWST instruments that have been identified as the consensus highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting planet characterization geometries (transits, eclipses, and phase curves), and target planets with host stars that span an illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations in this program were defined through an inclusive and transparent process that had participation from JWST instrument experts and international leaders in transiting exoplanet studies. Community engagement in the project will be centered on a two-phase Data Challenge that culminates with the delivery of planetary spectra, time-series instrument performance reports, and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the agenda for Cycle 2 of the JWST mission.},

Changes in surface color and plume distribution indicate differences in resurfacing processes near hot spots on Io. Patchy emissions were seen while Io was in eclipse by Jupiter. The outer margins of prominent linear markings (triple bands) on Europa are diffuse, suggesting that material has been vented from fractures. Numerous small circular craters indicate localized areas of relatively old surface. Pervasive brittle deformation of an ice layer appears to have formed grooves on Ganymede.

There are many processes that connect these aspects of planetary interiors, the most important of which are discussed here. Fundamentally, the dynamics of terrestrial bodies are driven by the transport of heat from the interior to the surface. Heat generation and transport are the processes that connect the structure and chemistry of a planetary body with its dynamical behavior, for example, volcanism, tectonism, and magnetism. The physical and chemical properties of planetary materials influence the mechanics of the planetary heat engine driving dynamics, while the dynamics in turn alter the physical and chemical properties of a planet's interior. Parametrization of the heat transport in planetary mantles has been a useful tool for studying the thermal evolution of terrestrial planetary bodies. Many physical processes have been incorporated in these models, including complex rheology (with temperature, pressure, stress, and composition dependence), partial melting, crust formation, core heat flux, and inner-core growth. These models are compared with observations of crustal and lithospheric properties, magnetic fields, tectonism, crustal formation, and volcanic activity to constrain the present state and past activity of the terrestrial planets and satellites.},

The transiting planet is confirmed using high-resolution optical transmission spectra from EXPRES. It is inflated, with \$R\_p = 1.875\textbackslash pm0.053\textbackslash,R\_\{\textbackslash rm J\}\$, and exhibits several interesting properties, including a misaligned orbit (\$\{240.34\^\{+0.93\}\_\{-0.98\}\}\$ degrees) and nearly grazing transit (\$b =0.9036\^\{+0.0061\}\_\{-0.0053\}\$). The planet orbits a fast-rotating F0 host star (\$T\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{eff\}\} \textbackslash simeq 7300\$ K) in 1.9 days and experiences intense irradiation. Notably, the TESS data show a clear secondary eclipse with a depth of \$364\textbackslash pm28\$ ppm and a significant phase curve signal, from which we obtain a relative day-night planetary flux difference of roughly 320 ppm and a 5.2\$\textbackslash sigma\$ detection of ellipsoidal distortion on the host star. Prompted by recent detections of atomic and ionized species in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres, we conduct an atmospheric cross-correlation analysis. We detect neutral iron (\$\{5.2\textbackslash sigma\}\$), at \$K\_p = 157\^\{+68\}\_\{-44\}\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ and \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm sys\} = -16\^\{+2\}\_\{-4\}\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$, adding another object to the small sample of highly irradiated gas-giant planets with Fe detections in transmission. Detections so far favor particularly inflated gas giants with radii \$\textbackslash gtrsim 1.78\textbackslash,R\_\{\textbackslash rm J\}\$; although this may be due to observational bias. With an equilibrium temperature of \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eq\}=2492\textbackslash pm38\$ K and a measured dayside brightness temperature of \$3237\textbackslash pm59\$ K (assuming zero geometric albedo), TOI-1518b is a promising candidate for future emission spectroscopy to probe for a thermal inversion.},

However, fully-flexible 3D planet models are overly complex for the data and computationally infeasible for data-fitting purposes. Here, we present ThERESA, a method to retrieve the 3D thermal structure of an exoplanet from eclipse observations by first retrieving 2D thermal maps at each wavelength and then placing them vertically in the atmosphere. This approach allows the 3D model to include complex thermal structures with a manageable number of parameters, hastening fit convergence and limiting overfitting. An analysis runs in a matter of days. We enforce consistency of the 3D model by comparing vertical placement of the 2D maps with their corresponding contribution functions. To test this approach, we generated a synthetic JWST NIRISS-like observation of a single hot-Jupiter eclipse using a global circulation model of WASP-76b and retrieved its 3D thermal structure. We find that a model which places the 2D maps at different depths depending on latitude and longitude is preferred over a model with a single pressure for each 2D map, indicating that ThERESA is able to retrieve 3D atmospheric structure from JWST observations. We successfully recover the temperatures of the planet's dayside, the eastward shift of its hotspot, and the thermal inversion. ThERESA is open-source and publicly available as a tool for the community.},

  abstract = {The analysis of exoplanetary atmospheres often relies upon the observation of transit or eclipse events. While very powerful, these snapshots provide mainly 1-dimensional information on the planet structure and do not easily allow precise latitude-longitude characterisations. The phase curve technique, which consists of measuring the planet emission throughout its entire orbit, can break this limitation and provide useful 2-dimensional thermal and chemical constraints on the atmosphere. As of today however, computing performances have limited our ability to perform unified retrieval studies on the full set of observed spectra from phase curve observations at the same time. Here, we present a new phase curve model that enables fast, unified retrieval capabilities. We apply our technique to the combined phase curve data from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes of the hot-Jupiter WASP-43 b. We tested different scenarios and discussed the dependence of our solution to different assumptions in the model. Our more comprehensive approach suggests that multiple interpretation of this dataset are possible but our more complex model is consistent with the presence of thermal inversions and a metal rich atmosphere, contrasting with previous data analyses, although this likely depends on the Spitzer data reduction. The detailed constraints extracted here demonstrate the importance of developing and understanding advanced phase curve techniques, which we believe will unlock access to a richer picture of exoplanet atmospheres.},

  abstract = {The magma ocean concept was first conceived to explain the geology of the Moon, but hemispherical or global oceans of silicate melt could be a widespread "lava world" phase of rocky planet accretion, and could persist on planets on short-period orbits around other stars. The formation and crystallization of magma oceans could be a defining stage in the assembly of a core, origin of a crust, initiation of tectonics, and formation of an atmosphere. The last decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of this phenomenon through analysis of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples, planetary missions, and astronomical observations of exoplanets. This review describes the energetic basis of magma oceans and lava worlds and the lava lake analogs available for study on Earth and Io. It provides an overview of evidence for magma oceans throughout the Solar System and considers the factors that control the rocks these magma oceans leave behind. It describes research on theoretical and observed exoplanets that could host extant magma oceans and summarizes efforts to detect and characterize them. It reviews modeling of the evolution of magma oceans as a result of crystallization and evaporation, the interaction with the underlying solid mantle, and the effects of planetary rotation. The review also considers theoretical investigations on the formation of an atmosphere in concert with the magma ocean and in response to irradiation from the host star, and possible end-states. Finally, it describes needs and gaps in our knowledge and points to future opportunities with new planetary missions and space telescopes to identify and better characterize lava worlds around nearby stars.},

The flow in the lower region (\textasciitilde 1 to 20 MPa) `dragged' to immobility and uniform temperature on a very short timescale, as in Liu \& Showman (2013), leads to effectively a complete cessation of variability as well as sensitivity in three-dimensional (3D) simulations with traditional primitive equations. Such momentum (Rayleigh) and thermal (Newtonian) drags are, however, ad hoc for 3D giant planet simulations. For 3D hot-Jupiter simulations, which typically already employ strong Newtonian drag in the upper region, sensitivity is not quenched if only the Newtonian drag is applied in the lower region, without the strong Rayleigh drag: in general, both sensitivity and variability persist if the two drags are not applied concurrently in the lower region. However, even when the drags are applied concurrently, vertically-propagating planetary waves give rise to significant variability in the \textasciitilde 0.05 to 0.5 MPa region, if the vertical resolution of the lower region is increased (e.g. here with 1000 layers for the entire domain). New observations on the effects of the physical setup and model convergence in `deep' atmosphere simulations are also presented.},

We attempt a statistical analysis of the albedo and redistribution efficiency for 24 transiting exoplanets that have at least one published secondary eclipse. For each planet, we show how to calculate a sub-stellar equilibrium temperature, T0, and associated uncertainty. We then use a simple model-independent technique to estimate a planet's effective temperature from planet/star flux ratios. We use thermal secondary eclipse measurements\textemdash those obtained at {$\lambda$} {$>$} 0.8 {$\mu$}m\textemdash to estimate day-side effective temperatures, Td, and thermal phase variations\textemdash when available\textemdash to estimate night-side effective temperature. We strongly rule out the ``null hypothesis'' of a single AB and {$\epsilon$} for all 24 planets. If we allow each planet to have different parameters, we find that low Bond albedos are favored (AB {$<$} 0.35 at 1{$\sigma$} confidence), which is an independent confirmation of the low albedos inferred from nondetections of reflected light. Our sample exhibits a wide variety of redistribution efficiencies. When normalized by T0, the day-side effective temperatures of the 24 planets describe a uni-modal distribution. The two biggest outliers are GJ 436b (abnormally hot) and HD 80606b (abnormally cool), and these are the only eccentric planets in our sample. The dimensionless quantity Td/T0 exhibits no trend with the presence or absence of stratospheric inversions. There is also no clear trend between Td/T0 and T0. That said, the six planets with the greatest sub-stellar equilibrium temperatures (T {$>$} 2400 K) have low {$\epsilon$}, as opposed to the 18 cooler planets, which show a variety of recirculation efficiencies. This hints that the very hottest transiting giant planets are qualitatively different from the merely hot Jupiters. We propose an explanation of this trend based on how a planet's radiative and advective times scale with temperature: both timescales are expected to be shorter for hotter planets, but the temperature dependence of the radiative timescale is stronger, leading to decreased heat recirculation efficiency.},

We present thermal phase observations of the hot Jupiter CoRoT-2b obtained with the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope. These measurements show the most robust detection to date of a westward hotspot offset of 23 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 4 degrees, in contrast with the nine other planets with equivalent measurements. The peculiar infrared flux map of CoRoT-2b may result from westward winds due to non-synchronous rotation magnetic effects, or partial cloud coverage, that obscures the emergent flux from the planet's eastern hemisphere. Non-synchronous rotation and magnetic effects may also explain the planet's anomalously large radius. On the other hand, partial cloud coverage could explain the featureless dayside emission spectrum of the planet. If CoRoT-2b is not tidally locked, then it means that our understanding of star-planet tidal interaction is incomplete. If the westward offset is due to magnetic effects, our result represents an opportunity to study an exoplanet's magnetic field. If it has Eastern clouds, then it means that our understanding of large-scale circulation on tidally locked planets is incomplete.},

Our methodology, like others, accounts for hydrothermal circulation in young oceanic crust by utilising a half-space cooling approximation. For the rest of Earth's surface, we estimate the average heat flow for different geologic domains as defined by global digital geology maps; and then produce the global estimate by multiplying it by the total global area of that geologic domain. The averaging is done on a polygon set which results from an intersection of a 1 degree equal area grid with the original geology polygons; this minimises the adverse influence of clustering. These operations and estimates are derived accurately using methodologies from Geographical Information Science. We consider the virtually un-sampled Antarctica separately and also make a small correction for hot-spots in young oceanic lithosphere. A range of analyses is presented. These, combined with statistical estimates of the error, provide a measure of robustness. Our final preferred estimate is 47\&plusmn;2 TW, which is greater than previous estimates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present a map of Io's volcanic heat flow. Io's high heat flow is a result of intense tidal heating, which generates widespread volcanic activity. The surface expression of ongoing volcanic activity constrains the location and magnitude of tidal dissipation within Io. Tidal heating models place heating either at relatively shallow (aesthenosphere) levels, or deep in the mantle. It was thought that actual tidal heating could be approximated using a combination of these end-member models. Io's volcanic heat flow has now been mapped in sufficient detail to compare with the models. Our maps show that the distribution of heat flow is not matched by current models of deep nor shallow tidal heating, nor by any combination of these two models. We find relatively low heat flow at sub-jovian (0\textdegree W) and anti-jovian (180\textdegree W) longitudes, at odds with the pure aesthenospheric heating model. Furthermore, there are large swaths of Io's surface where there is poor correlation between the number of hot spots in an area and the power emitted. We have previously accounted for \%54\% of Io's observed heat flow. We now show that Io's anomalously warm poles, possibly the result of heat flow from deep-mantle heating, would yield the ``missing'' energy (48 TW) if the polar surfaces are at temperatures of \$90 K to \$95 K and cover latitudes above \$43\textdegree{} to \$48\textdegree{} respectively. This possibility implies a ratio of deep to shallow heating of about 1:1. However, explaining regional variations in surface volcanic activity requires more detailed modeling of the location and magnitude of the internal tidal dissipation and the consequences of mantle convection and advection within Io. Future model predictions can be compared to our heat flow map.},

While this exoplanet's bulk density indicates a possible atmosphere, one has not been detected definitively. Our analysis relies on the Doppler cross-correlation technique, which takes advantage of the high spectral resolution and broad wavelength coverage of our data, to search for the thousands of absorption features from hydrogen-, carbon-, and nitrogen-rich molecular species in the planetary atmosphere. Although we are unable to detect an atmosphere around 55 Cancri e, we do place strong constraints on the levels of HCN, NH\$\{\}\_3\$, and C\$\{\}\_2\$H\$\{\}\_2\$ that may be present. In particular, at a mean molecular weight of 5 amu we can rule out the presence of HCN in the atmosphere down to a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of 0.02\%, NH\$\{\}\_3\$ down to a VMR of 0.08\%, and C\$\{\}\_2\$H\$\{\}\_2\$ down to a VMR of 1.0\%.

We have conducted a campaign of high-cadence observations of Io with the goal of characterizing its volcanic activity. Between Aug 2013 and the end of 2015, we imaged Io on 100 nights in the near-infrared with adaptive optics on the Keck and Gemini N telescopes, which resolve emission from individual volcanic hot spots. During our program, we made over 400 detections of 48 distinct hot spots, some of which were detected 30+ times. We use these observations to derive a timeline of global volcanic activity on Io, which exhibits wide variability from month to month. The timelines of thermal activity at individual volcanic centers have geophysical implications, and will permit future characterization by others. We evaluate hot spot detection limits and give a simple parameterization of the minimum detectable intensity as a function of emission angle, which can be applied to other analyses. We detected three outburst eruptions in August 2013, but no other outburst-scale events were observed in the subsequent {$\sim$}90 observations. Either the cluster of events in August 2013 was a rare occurrence, or there is a mechanism causing large events to occur closely-spaced in time. We also detected large eruptions (though not of outburst scale) within days of one another at Kurdalagon Patera and Sethlaus/Gabija Paterae in 2015. As was also seen in the Galileo dataset, the hot spots we detected can be separated into two categories based on their thermal emission: those that are persistently active for 1 year or more at moderate intensity, and those that are only briefly active, are time-variable, and often reach large intensities. A small number of hot spots in the latter category appear and subside in a matter of days, reaching particularly high intensities; although these are not bright enough to qualify as outbursts, their thermal signatures follow the same pattern, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be responsible for these events though at a smaller scale.},

  abstract = {Loki Patera is one of the most dramatically time-variable volcanic features on Io, exhibiting episodic brightening events every 1\textendash 3 years that may produce over 15\% of Io's global heat flow. We observed three such brightening events with adaptive optics imaging at the Keck and Gemini N telescopes over the course of 70 nights of observation in 2013\textendash 2016. The high cadence and multi-wavelength nature of the observations provides constraints on models for activity at Loki Patera. The Matson et al. (2006) model for Loki Patera as an overturning basaltic magma sea is adapted to fit the observations of all three events. In particular, we adjust the details of the overturn progression, and modify the lava thermal properties to include dependencies on temperature and porosity, to improve the fit to the data. The preferred models find overturn front propagation velocities of 1.2\textendash 1.7 km/day, corresponding to resurfacing rates of 1500\textendash 2200 m2/s. The time intervals of 440\textendash 540 days between successive events are roughly consistent with the 540-day period calculated by Rathbun et al. (2002) for events prior to 2001. The best coverage was obtained for the 2016 brightening; model fits to this event require a lava bulk thermal conductivity of 0.55\textendash 0.75 W/m/K, with the best fit obtained for a value of {$\sim$}0.7 W/m/K and an average porosity that decreases during cooling. For all three events, the overturn front appears to propagate around the patera in the clockwise direction, opposite to what has been inferred for past brightening events. There is evidence that the overturn may be more complex than a single propagating wave, perhaps involving multiple simultaneous resurfacing waves as well as portions of the patera that are active even after the nominal bright phase has ended. The measured intensities are anomalously low when Loki Patera is viewed at high emission angles, suggestive of topographic shadowing due to a raised area or the edge of the depression in which the magma sea resides.},

  abstract = {We present new visible and infrared observations of the hot Jupiter Kepler-7b to determine its atmospheric properties. Our analysis allows us to (1) refine Kepler-7b's relatively large geometric albedo of Ag = 0.35 {$\pm$} 0.02, (2) place upper limits on Kepler-7b thermal emission that remains undetected in both Spitzer bandpasses and (3) report a westward shift in the Kepler optical phase curve. We argue that Kepler-7b's visible flux cannot be due to thermal emission or Rayleigh scattering from H2 molecules. We therefore conclude that high altitude, optically reflective clouds located west from the substellar point are present in its atmosphere. We find that a silicate-based cloud composition is a possible candidate. Kepler-7b exhibits several properties that may make it particularly amenable to cloud formation in its upper atmosphere. These include a hot deep atmosphere that avoids a cloud cold trap, very low surface gravity to suppress cloud sedimentation, and a planetary equilibrium temperature in a range that allows for silicate clouds to potentially form in the visible atmosphere probed by Kepler. Our analysis does not only present evidence of optically thick clouds on Kepler-7b but also yields the first map of clouds in an exoplanet atmosphere.},

Numerous efforts to observe the spectra of super-Earths\textemdash exoplanets with masses of one to ten times that of Earth\textemdash have so far revealed only featureless spectra. Here we report a longitudinal thermal brightness map of the nearby transiting super-Earth 55 Cancri e (refs 4, 5) revealing highly asymmetric dayside thermal emission and a strong day-night temperature contrast. Dedicated space-based monitoring of the planet in the infrared revealed a modulation of the thermal flux as 55 Cancri e revolves around its star in a tidally locked configuration. These observations reveal a hot spot that is located 41\,{$\pm$}\,12 degrees east of the substellar point (the point at which incident light from the star is perpendicular to the surface of the planet). From the orbital phase curve, we also constrain the nightside brightness temperature of the planet to 1,380\,{$\pm$}\,400 kelvin and the temperature of the warmest hemisphere (centred on the hot spot) to be about 1,300 kelvin hotter (2,700\,{$\pm$}\,270 kelvin) at a wavelength of 4.5 micrometres, which indicates inefficient heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside. Our observations are consistent with either an optically thick atmosphere with heat recirculation confined to the planetary dayside, or a planet devoid of atmosphere with low-viscosity magma flows at the surface.},

Keck II telescope on 18 December 2001 (UT) before the satellite went into eclipse, and while it was in Jupiter's shadow. Making these kind of Io-in-eclipse observations, as well as the associated data reduction and analysis are challenging; hence one focus of the paper is to explain the methods and tools used for these data sets. For the sunlit images Io itself was used as the wavefront reference source, while nearby Ganymede was used as reference 'star' when Io was in eclipse. Observations were obtained in K'-, L'-, and M-bands. The sunlit images have been deconvolved using MISTRAL. The Io-in-eclipse data were deconvolved with IDAC and MISTRAL. The former gives better results, both in absolute photometry and in matching the original images. We determined the flux densities of the hot spots from the original Io-in-eclipse data with StarFinder, as well as from the deconvolved images by integrating the intensity over the relevant areas. We determined the highly anisoplanatic PSF via a FFT method from the original data, and used this in StarFinder and as a starting PSF for IDAC and MISTRAL. We derived temperatures and areal coverage of all 19 spots detected in both K'- and L'-band images of Io-in-eclipse. We also determined temperatures and areal coverage of the hot spots visible on the L'- and M-band images of sunlit Io. Most volcanoes contain a compact hot 'core' ({$\lessequivlnt$}10 km 2 at 600-800 K) within a larger area at lower temperatures (e.g., {$\sim$}10 2-10 4 km 2 at 300-500 K). The total heat flow contributed by these active volcanoes is 0.2 W m -2, {$\sim$}8\% of the average global heat flow measured at 5-20 {$\mu$}m by Veeder et al. [J. Geophys. Res. 99 (1994) 17095].},

Adding these data to those published by Rathbun and Spencer (2006) and the Gemini data of de Kleer and de Pater (2016a, 2017) results in a database of 3.5\textendash 3.8 {$\mu$}m emission from Loki Patera over almost 3 decades. Data presented here contain adaptive optics (AO) observations of Io's sunlit hemisphere at wavelengths between 1.6 and 5 {$\mu$}m, AO observations of Io in eclipse at 2\textendash 5 {$\mu$}m, and non-AO observations of Io in eclipse at 1.6\textendash 12 {$\mu$}m. The non-AO data were taken in September of 1999, during the early phase of a brightening event that was documented by Howell et al. (2001). Dual-component Io Flow model (IFM) fits to our 1999 observations show a mostly cool lava crust over almost the entire patera floor, with a relatively small hotter component making up less than 1\% of the total area, consistent with previous observations. The 30-year timeline of Loki Patera revealed that, after an apparent cessation of, or change in, brightening events in 2002, Loki Patera became active again in 2009. The more recent activity may have a slightly shorter periodicity than observed by Rathbun et al. (2002), and the direction of flow propagation appears to have reversed. Since 2009 the flow direction is in the clockwise direction, starting in the north or north-east corner and propagating along the patera towards the south-west. During the Galileo era the propagation was in the counter-clockwise direction, starting in the south-west and propagating towards the east. Both the 30-year timeline and the 1.6\textendash 12 {$\mu$}m spectrum that was obtained during the brightening event in 1999 agree well with Matson et al.'s (2006) overturning lava lake model, as modified by de Kleer and de Pater (2017).},

There is clear evidence of volcanic plumes on 20 March and 2 September. The plumes distort the line profiles, causing high-velocity (\$\textbackslash gtrsim\$500 m/s) wings, and red/blue-shifted shoulders in the line profiles. During eclipse ingress, the SO\$\_2\$ flux density dropped exponentially, and the atmosphere reformed in a linear fashion when re-emerging in sunlight, with a "post-eclipse brightening" after \$\textbackslash sim\$10 minutes. While both the in-eclipse decrease and in-sunlight increase in SO was more gradual than for SO\$\_2\$, the fact that SO decreased at all is evidence that self-reactions at the surface are important and fast, and that in-sunlight photolysis of SO\$\_2\$ is the dominant source of SO. Disk-integrated SO\$\_2\$ in-sunlight flux densities are \$\textbackslash sim\$2--3 times higher than in-eclipse, indicative of a roughly 30--50\textbackslash\% contribution from volcanic sources to the atmosphere. Typical column densities and temperatures are \$N \textbackslash approx (1.5 \textbackslash pm 0.3) \textbackslash times 10\^\{16\}\$ cm\$\^\{-2\}\$ and \$T \textbackslash approx 220-320\$ K both in-sunlight and in-eclipse, while the fractional coverage of the gas is 2--3 times lower in-eclipse than in-sunlight. The low level SO\$\_2\$ emissions present during eclipse may be sourced by stealth volcanism or be evidence of a layer of non-condensible gases preventing complete collapse of the SO\$\_2\$ atmosphere. The melt in magma chambers at different volcanoes must differ in composition to explain the absence of SO and SO\$\_2\$, but simultaneous presence of KCl over Ulgen Patera.},

  abstract = {Methods. We use archived Spitzer/IRAC 8-\textmu m data of HD 189733 (six transits, eight secondary eclipses, and a phase curve) in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for mitigating systematics. We also include HD 189733's out-of-transit radial velocity (RV) measurements to assess their incidence on the inferences obtained solely from the photometry. Results. We find a 6{$\sigma$} deviation from the expected occultation of a uniformly-bright disk. This deviation emerges mainly from a large-scale hot spot in HD 189733b's atmosphere, not from HD 189733b's shape. We indicate that the correlation of the exoplanet orbital eccentricity, e, and BD (``uniform time offset'') does also depend on the stellar density, {$\rho$} , and the exoplanet impact parameter, b (``e-b-{$\rho$} -BD correlation''). For HD 189733b, we find that relaxing the eccentricity constraint and using more complex BDs lead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized and latitudinally-shifted hot spot. We, therefore, show that the light curve of an exoplanet does not constrain uniquely its brightness peak localization. Finally, we obtain an improved constraint on the upper limit of HD 189733b's orbital eccentricity, e {$\leq$} 0.011 (95\% confidence), when including HD 189733's RV measurements. Conclusions. Reanalysis of archived HD 189733's data constrains HD 189733b's shape and BD at 8 \textmu m. Our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curves and a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. In particular, observations of the same exoplanet at different wavelengths could improve the constraints on HD 189733's system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3D map of HD 189733b's atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the perspective of extending our method to observations in the visible (e.g., Kepler data), in particular to better understand exoplanet albedos.},

For example, 3.6 {$\mu$}m emission originates from deeper layers of the atmosphere than 4.5 {$\mu$}m due to greater water vapor absorption at the longer wavelength. Because heat transport efficiency increases with pressure, we expect thermal phase curves at 3.6 {$\mu$}m to exhibit smaller amplitudes and greater phase offsets than at 4.5 {$\mu$}m\textemdash yet this trend is not observed. Of the seven hot Jupiters with full-orbit phase curves at 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m, all of them have greater phase amplitude at 3.6 {$\mu$}m than at 4.5 {$\mu$}m, while four of the seven exhibit a greater phase offset at 3.6 {$\mu$}m. We use a 3D radiative-hydrodynamic model to calculate theoretical phase curves of HD189733b, assuming thermo-chemical equilibrium. The model exhibits temperature, pressure, and wavelength-dependent opacity, primarily driven by carbon chemistry: CO is energetically favored on the dayside, while CH4 is favored on the cooler nightside. Infrared opacity, therefore, changes by orders of magnitude between day and night, producing dramatic vertical shifts in the wavelength-specific photospheres, which would complicate eclipse or phase mapping with spectral data. The model predicts greater relative phase amplitude and greater phase offset at 3.6 {$\mu$}m than at 4.5 {$\mu$}m, in agreement with the data. Our model qualitatively explains the observed phase curves, but it is in tension with current thermo-chemical kinetics models that predict zonally uniform atmospheric composition due to the transport of CO from the hot regions of the atmosphere.},

Methods: We apply a Maxwell viscoelastic rheology to compute the tidal response of the planets using the volume-weighted average of the viscosities and rigidities of the metal, rock, high-pressure ice, and liquid water/ice I layers. Results: We show that TRAPPIST-1d and e can avoid entering a runaway greenhouse state. Planet e is the most likely to support a habitable environment, with Earth-like surface temperatures and possibly liquid water oceans. Planet d also avoids a runaway greenhouse, if its surface reflectance is at least as high as that of the Earth. Planets b and c, closer to the star, have heat fluxes high enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse and to support volcanism on the surfaces of their rock layers, rendering them too warm for life. Planets f, g, and h are too far from the star to experience significant tidal heating, and likely have solid ice surfaces with possible subsurface liquid water oceans.},

Time-resolved reflected light from an exoplanet encodes information about atmospheric and surface inhomogeneities. Previous research has shown that the light curve of an exoplanet can be inverted to obtain a low-resolution map of the planet, as well as constraints on its spin orientation. Estimating the uncertainty on 2D albedo maps has so far remained elusive. Here, we present exocartographer, a flexible open-source Bayesian framework for solving the exocartography inverse problem. The map is parameterized with equal-area Hierarchical, Equal Area, and isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) pixels. For a fiducial map resolution of 192 pixels, a four-parameter Gaussian process describing the spatial scale of albedo variations, and two unknown planetary spin parameters, exocartographer explores a 198-dimensional parameter space. To test the code, we produce a light curve for a cloudless Earth in a face-on orbit with a 90\textdegree{} obliquity. We produce synthetic white-light observations of the planet: five epochs of observations throughout the planet's orbit, each consisting of 24 hourly observations with a photometric uncertainty of 1\% (120 data points). We retrieve an albedo map and\textemdash for the first time\textemdash its uncertainties, along with spin constraints.

Image cubes from December 2014 in eight spectral channels, with spectral resolutions of R {$\sim$}2000-12,000 and spatial resolutions of 2\textendash 4\textdegree{} latitude, are inverted to generate 3D maps of tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures, 2D maps of upper tropospheric aerosols, phosphine and ammonia, and 2D maps of stratospheric ethane and acetylene. The results are compared to a re-analysis of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observations acquired during Cassini's closest approach to Jupiter in December 2000, demonstrating that this new archive of ground-based mapping spectroscopy can match and surpass the quality of previous investigations, and will permit future studies of Jupiter's evolving atmosphere. The visibility of cool zones and warm belts varies from channel to channel, suggesting complex vertical variations from the radiatively-controlled upper troposphere to the convective mid-troposphere. We identify mid-infrared signatures of Jupiter's 5-\textmu m hotspots via simultaneous M, N and Q-band observations, which are interpreted as temperature and ammonia variations in the northern Equatorial Zone and on the edge of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB). Equatorial plumes enriched in NH3 gas are located south-east of NH3-desiccated `hotspots' on the edge of the NEB. Comparison of the hotspot locations in several channels across the 5\textendash 20~\textmu m range indicate that these anomalous regions tilt westward with altitude. Aerosols and PH3 are both enriched at the equator but are not co-located with the NH3 plumes. The equatorial temperature minimum and PH3/aerosol maxima have varied in amplitude over time, possibly as a result of periodic equatorial brightenings and the fresh updrafts of disequilibrium material. Temperate mid-latitudes display a correlation between mid-IR aerosol opacity and the white albedo features in visible light (i.e., zones). We find hemispheric asymmetries in the distribution of tropospheric PH3, stratospheric hydrocarbons and the 2D wind field (estimated via the thermal-wind equation) that suggest a differing efficiency of mechanical forcing (e.g., vertical mixing and wave propagation) between the two hemispheres that we argue is driven by dynamics rather than Jupiter's small seasonal cycle. Jupiter's stratosphere is notably warmer at northern mid-latitudes than in the south in both 2000 and 2014, although the latter can be largely attributed to strong thermal wave activity near 30\textdegree N that dominates the 2014 stratospheric maps and may be responsible for elevated C2H2 in the northern hemisphere. A vertically-variable pattern of temperature and windshear minima and maxima associated with Jupiter's Quasi Quadrennial Oscillation (QQO) is observed at the equator in both datasets, although the contrasts were more subdued in 2014. Large-scale equator-to-pole gradients in ethane and acetylene are superimposed on top of the mid-latitude mechanically-driven maxima, with C2H2 decreasing from equator to pole and C2H6 showing a polar enhancement, consistent with a radiatively-controlled circulation from low to high latitudes. Cold polar vortices beyond {$\sim$}60\textdegree{} latitude can be identified in the upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature maps, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling from polar aerosols. Finally, compositional mapping of the Great Red Spot confirms the local enhancements in PH3 and aerosols, the north\textendash south asymmetry in NH3 gas and the presence of a warm southern periphery that have been noted by previous authors.},

  abstract = {The planetary and lunar ephemerides DE430 and DE431 are generated by fitting numerically integrated orbits of the Moon and planets to observations. The present-day lunar orbit is known to submeter accuracy through fitting lunar laser ranging data with an updated lunar gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. The orbits of the inner planets are known to subkilometer accuracy through fitting radio tracking measurements of spacecraft in orbit about them. Very long baseline interferometry measurements of spacecraft at Mars allow the orientation of the ephemeris to be tied to the International Celestial Reference Frame with an accuracy of 0''.0002. This orientation is the limiting error source for the orbits of the terrestrial planets, and corresponds to orbit uncertainties of a few hundred meters. The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are determined to accuracies of tens of kilometers as a result of fitting spacecraft tracking data. The orbits of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are determined primarily from astrometric observations, for which measurement uncertainties due to the Earth's atmosphere, combined with star catalog uncertainties, limit position accuracies to several thousand kilometers. DE430 and DE431 differ in their integrated time span and lunar dynamical modeling. The dynamical model for DE430 included a damping term between the Moon's liquid core and solid mantle that gives the best fit to lunar laser ranging data but that is not suitable for backward integration of more than a few centuries. The ephemeris DE431 is similar to DE430 but was fit without the core/mantle damping term, so the lunar orbit is less accurate than in DE430 for times near the current epoch, but is more suitable for times more than a few centuries in the past. DE431 is a longer integration (covering years -13,200 to +17,191) than DE430 (covering years 1550 to 2650).},

Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators\textemdash providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice\textemdash but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

Finally we discuss aspects of their atmospheres in the context of observations and 1D and 3D models, including atmospheric structure and escape, spectroscopic signatures, and complex atmospheric circulation. The major opacity sources in these atmospheres, including alkali metals, water vapor, and others, are discussed.

Perhaps a bit surprisingly, the understanding to its model identifiability---the major reason behind the interpretability in many applications such as topic mining and hyperspectral imaging---had been rather limited until recent years. Beginning from the 2010s, the identifiability research of NMF has progressed considerably: Many interesting and important results have been discovered by the signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) communities. NMF identifiability has a great impact on many aspects in practice, such as ill-posed formulation avoidance and performance-guaranteed algorithm design. On the other hand, there is no tutorial paper that introduces NMF from an identifiability viewpoint. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by offering a comprehensive and deep tutorial on model identifiability of NMF as well as the connections to algorithms and applications. This tutorial will help researchers and graduate students grasp the essence and insights of NMF, thereby avoiding typical `pitfalls' that are often times due to unidentifiable NMF formulations. This paper will also help practitioners pick/design suitable factorization tools for their own problems.},

The eight nights of observations were all obtained in L' band (3.8-microns) from February to May 2014. The images do not resolve individual hotspots; however by analyzing the light curve and fitting an occultation model to the data we are able to determine the spectral flux and location of distinct hotspots. Loki Patera, and Janus Patera and/or Kanehekili Fluctus are the most likely candidates for detected hotspots across all of the nights. We compare the absolute flux densiti of the individual volcanoes over this period to observe decreases in brightness over the four month time period.

  abstract = {The thermal phase curve of 55 Cancri e is the first measurement of the temperature distribution of a tidally locked super-Earth, but raises a number of puzzling questions about the planet's climate. The phase curve has a high amplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a significant eastward hot-spot shift as well as a large day-night temperature contrast. We use a general circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the relation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these seemingly contradictory features. We confirm theoretical models of tidally locked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and rule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic properties. Our best-fitting atmosphere has a significant hot-spot shift and day-night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase curve. We discuss possible physical processes that could explain the observations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO from a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve amplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could be explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight, a surface pressure of several bars, and a strong eastward circulation, with night-side cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between our model and the observations.},

Of particular interest is the relationship between the albedo measured at superior conjunction, known as the ``geometric albedo", and the albedo considered over all orbital phase angles, known as the ``spherical albedo". Determining the relationship between the geometric and spherical albedos usually involves complex numerical calculations and closed-form solutions are restricted to simple reflection laws. Here we report the discovery of closed-form solutions for the geometric albedo and integral phase function, which apply to any law of reflection that only depends on the scattering angle. The shape of a reflected light phase curve, quantified by the integral phase function, and the secondary eclipse depth, quantified by the geometric albedo, may now be self-consistently inverted to retrieve globally averaged physical parameters. Fully Bayesian phase curve inversions for reflectance maps and simultaneous light curve detrending may now be performed due to the efficiency of computation. Demonstrating these innovations for the hot Jupiter Kepler-7b, we infer a geometric albedo of \$0.25\^\{+0.01\}\_\{-0.02\}\$, a phase integral of \$1.77 \textbackslash pm0.07\$, a spherical albedo of \$0.44\^\{+0.02\}\_\{-0.03\}\$ and a scattering asymmetry factor of \$0.07\^\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.11\}\$.},

The term 'lava world' may refer to any planet with extensive surface lava lakes, while the term 'magma ocean world' refers to planets with global or hemispherical magma oceans at their surface. 'Highly volcanic planets', including super-Ios, may simply have large, or large numbers of, active explosive or extrusive volcanoes of any form. They are plausibly highly diverse, with magmatic processes across a wide range of compositions, temperatures, activity rates, volcanic eruption styles, and background gravitational force magnitudes. Worlds in all these classes are likely to be the most characterizable rocky exoplanets in the near future due to observational advantages that stem from their preferential occurrence in short orbital periods and their bright day-side flux in the infrared. Transit techniques should enable a level of characterization of these worlds analogous to hot Jupiters. Understanding processes on highly volcanic worlds is critical to interpret imminent observations. The physical states of these worlds are likely to inform not just geodynamic processes, but also planet formation, and phenomena crucial to habitability. Volcanic and magmatic activity uniquely allows chemical investigation of otherwise spectroscopically inaccessible interior compositions. These worlds will be vital to assess the degree to which planetary interior element abundances compare to their stellar hosts, and may also offer pathways to study both the very young Earth, and the very early form of many silicate planets where magma oceans and surface lava lakes are expected to be more prevalent. We suggest that highly volcanic worlds may become second only to habitable worlds in terms of both scientific and public long-term interest.},

The potential occultations would cover a wide range of latitudes including the auroral regions of Jupiter, which have not been measured in previous missions. Occultations of the neutral atmosphere would provide additional reference temperatures for T-p profiles used in retrievals of data from the Juno Microwave Radiometer (MWR). Additionally, occultations of the auroral regions could verify previous MWR data that suggests the auroral zones have significantly higher electron densities than the non-auroral ionosphere.

At Loki a brightening began between August 25 and September 9 and continued through February. On August 2 a major outburst was observed near (14\textdegree N, 74\textdegree W) whose brightness corresponds to an area of approximately 350 km2 at a temperature of 1100 K. Observations of eruptions in late June (9906A) and in late November (9911A, at Tvashtar) provide temporal and photometric constraints on activity also seen by Galileo.

  abstract = {Occultations of Io by Jupiter and by other satellites provide a long-term record of the brightness of individual volcanic hotspots. They also provide our highest spatial resolution observations of individual volcanic centers such as Loki. We are in the process of reanalyzing observations spanning the years 1985 through 2015 for submission to the NASA Planetary Data System. The Jupiter occultation observations have spatial resolution limited to roughly the Jupiter atmospheric scale height (22 km) but as these events occur every Io orbit we have data on over 100. They include observations from the NASA-IRTF, WIRO, Lowell, and other telescopes on Mauna Kea. Part of this data set originally revealed the semi-periodic nature of the activity at Loki (Rathbun et al. 2002). A series of mutual satellite occultations occurs only every six years but the sharp limb of the other satellite allows for much higher spatial resolution. The original analysis was limited by inaccuracies in the satellite ephemerides but improvements now allow us to more reliably assign brightnesses to individual hotspots. They also allow improved image reconstructions of individual spots from mutual events. We will report on our tests of that better ephemeris, the improved assignment of hotspot brightnesses, and the reconstructed mutual event images.}

General satellite information such as physical constants and descriptive orbital elements can be found on the JPL Solar System Dynamics Website (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov). JPL's ephemerides directly support planetary spacecraft missions both in navigation and science data analysis. They are also used in general scientific investigations of planetary systems. We produce the ephemerides by fitting numerically integrated orbits to observational data. Our model for the satellite dynamics accounts for the gravitational interactions within a planetary system and the external gravitational perturbations from the Sun and planets. We rely on an extensive data set to determine the parameters in our dynamical models. The majority of the observations are visual, photographic, and CCD astrometry acquired from Earthbased observatories worldwide and the Hubble Space Telescope. Additional observations include optical and photoelectric transits, eclipses, occultations, Earthbased radar ranging, spacecraft imaging,and spacecraft radiometric tracking. The latter data provide information on the planet and satellite gravity fields as well as the satellite position at the times of spacecraft close encounters. In this paper we report on the status of the ephemerides and our plan for future development, specifically that in support of NASA's Juno, Cassini, and New Horizons missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto, respectively.}

Its atmosphere may be water-rich and have a large scale-height, though attempts to characterize it have yielded ambiguous results. Here we present a sensitive search for water and TiO in its atmosphere at high spectral resolution using the Gemini North telescope and the GRACES spectrograph. We combine observations with previous observations from Subaru and CFHT, improving the constraints on the presence of water vapor. We adopt parametric models with an updated planet radius based on recent measurements, and use a cross-correlation technique to maximize sensitivity. Our results are consistent with atmospheres that are cloudy or contain minimal amounts of water and TiO. Using these parametric models, we rule out a water-rich atmosphere (VMR {$>$}= 0.1\%) with a mean molecular weight of {$<$}= 15 g/mol at a 3 sigma confidence level, improving on the previous limit by a significant margin. For TiO, we rule out a mean molecular weight of {$<$}= 5 g/mol with a 3 sigma confidence level for a VMR greater than 10\^-8; for a VMR of greater than 10\^-7, the limit rises to a mean molecular weight of {$<$}= 10 g/mol. We can rule out low mean-molecular-weight chemical equilibrium models both including and excluding TiO/VO at very high confidence levels ({$>$} 10 sigma). Overall, our results are consistent with an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight and/or clouds, or no atmosphere.},

Nevertheless, we achieve high accuracy even for very large band-limits.

We conduct numerical experiments to study in detail the stability, accuracy and computational complexity of the proposed transforms. We also highlight the advantages of the proposed sampling scheme and associated transforms in the context of potential applications.},

We expect hot-Jupiter atmospheres to be dynamic environments exhibiting time varying weather. However, it is uncertain to what extent temporal variability will be observable when considering disk integrated observations. We do not detect statistically significant variability and are able to place useful upper limits on the infrared variability amplitudes in these atmospheres. There are very few planets with multi-epoch observations at the required precision to probe variability in dayside emission. The observations considered in this study span several years, providing insight into temporal variability at multiple timescales. In the case of HD 189733b, the best-fit eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 102 ppm about a median depth of 1827 ppm and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 88 ppm about a median depth of 1481 ppm. For HD 209458b, the best-fit eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 22 ppm about a median depth of 1406 ppm, and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 131 ppm about a median depth of 1092 ppm. The precision and scatter in these observations allow us to constrain variability to less than (5.6\% and 6.0\%) and (12\% and 1.6\%) for channels (1, 2) of HD 189733b and HD 209458b, respectively.},

  abstract = {Jupiter's moon Io possesses numerous tectonic mountains in addition to its ubiquitous volcanoes and volcanic features. Remarkably, a distinct global anticorrelation exists between the spatial distribution of mountains and volcanic centers on Io. This relationship indicates an explicit connection between volcanism and mountain formation, even though the mountains are tectonic in origin (predominantly upthrusted crustal blocks). Spherical harmonic analysis shows the distribution of mountains and volcanic centers have statistically significant power at degree 2; this result is especially striking for the volcanic center distribution, and directly implicates models of asthenospheric tidal heating. The latter predict enhanced heat flux along the equator in a degree-two pattern that matches observations. Mountain formation on Io appears to be a form of dominantly vertical tectonism unique in the modern Solar System: continual burial by widespread volcanism drives the crust inward, which leads to strong compression, and at discrete locations, mountains. Correlation coefficients between the volcanic and mountain distributions indicate statistically meaningful anticorrelation at low spectral degrees (l = 1, 2, 4, and 6); the anticorrelation is especially significant between the longitudinal (sectorial) l = 2 components when considered on their own. We compare this anticorrelation with published models that link volcano and mountain formation. While consistent in part with l = 2 convection models, which predict such an anticorrelation (in principle), such low degree anticorrelations are also (if not more) compatible with mountain formation due to, or influenced by, thermal expansion of Io's crust, and deep compression and thrust faulting in regions of lower than average volcanic heat-piping. Positive correlations between mountain and volcanic center distributions at high spectral degree may reflect structural links between a good fraction of mountain blocks and adjacent volcanic paterae, whereas the anticorrelation at low degree implies that most volcanic features (which are far more numerous overall) form independently of mountains.},

We suggest electromagnetic induction heating as an energy source inside these planets. If the stellar rotation and magnetic dipole axes are inclined with respect to each other, induction heating can melt the upper mantle and enormously increase volcanic activity, sometimes producing a magma ocean below the planetary surface. We show that induction heating leads the four innermost TRAPPIST-1 planets, one of which is in the habitable zone, either to evolve towards a molten mantle planet, or to experience increased outgassing and volcanic activity, while the three outermost planets remain mostly unaffected.},

  abstract = {The widespread volcanism on the Jovian moon Io is powered by tidal heating, yet we lack a deep understanding of how this distinctive heating process affects the locations, timing, or intensities of Io's eruptions. We show that the quasiperiodic behavior of the volcano Loki Patera in 1987\textendash 2018 matches the timescales for the evolution of Io's eccentricity and semimajor axis (\textasciitilde 480 and \textasciitilde 460 days). If this orbital forcing is driving Loki Patera's variability, a low-pass geophysical filter such as poroelastic flow, or a resonant amplification of Io's wobble, could account for the importance of these long-period orbital variations despite their small amplitudes. The peak volcanic response is predicted to roughly coincide with Io's maximum eccentricity, consistent with the observations. High-cadence observations over the next several years have the potential to conclusively discriminate between orbital versus geophysical control of Loki Patera's variability. Plain Language Summary Tidal heating is one of the central processes that generates heat in the interiors of planets and moons and is in part responsible for the existence of subsurface oceans and geological activity on moons in the outer solar system. Under this process, the amount of heating that occurs, and the stresses in the crust, vary periodically with the periodic tidal flexing. As a result, we might expect that any geological activity powered by tidal heating, such as volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's tidally heated moon Io, would also vary periodically. Indeed, the water geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus vary in strength over the course of Enceladus' orbit around Saturn due to tides opening and closing fissures. Io takes only 1.77 days to orbit Jupiter, but its orbit is also slowly changing in time with a period of \textasciitilde 480 days. We compare the variability of Io's volcanoes with the evolution of its orbit and find that the quasiperiodic behavior of Loki Patera, the most powerful volcano on Io, follows a similar pattern as the orbital changes. We explore whether this volcano could be brightening and fading in response to changes in the heating and stresses produced by tides in its interior and what implications this has for the geophysical processes in Io's interior.},

  abstract = {Most rocky planets in the galaxy orbit a cool host star, and there is  large uncertainty among theoretical models whether these planets can retain an atmosphere. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) might be able to settle this question empirically, but most proposals for doing so require large observational effort because they are based on spectroscopy. Here we show that infrared photometry of secondary eclipses could quickly identify ``candidate'' atmospheres, by searching for rocky planets with atmospheres thick enough that atmospheric heat transport noticeably reduces their dayside thermal emission compared to that of a bare rock. For a planet amenable to atmospheric follow-up, we find that JWST should be able to confidently detect the heat redistribution signal of an \{ \textbackslash mathcal O \}(1) bar atmosphere with one to two eclipses. One to two eclipses is generally much less than the effort needed to infer an atmosphere via transmission or emission spectroscopy. Candidate atmospheres can be further validated via follow-up spectroscopy or phase curves. In addition, because this technique is fast it could enable a first atmospheric survey of rocky exoplanets with JWST. We estimate that the TESS mission will find {$\sim$}100 planets that are too hot to be habitable but that can be quickly probed via eclipse photometry. Knowing whether hot, rocky planets around M dwarfs have atmospheres is important not only for understanding the evolution of uninhabitable worlds: if atmospheres are common on hot planets, then cooler, potentially habitable planets around M dwarfs are also likely to have atmospheres.},

  abstract = {Hot Jupiters receive intense incident stellar light on their daysides, which drives vigorous atmospheric circulation that attempts to erase their large dayside-to-nightside flux contrasts. Propagating waves and instabilities in hot Jupiter atmospheres can cause emergent properties of the atmosphere to be time-variable. In this work, we study such weather in hot Jupiter atmospheres using idealized cloud-free general circulation models with double-gray radiative transfer. We find that hot Jupiter atmospheres can be time-variable at the {$\sim$}0.1\%\textendash 1\% level in globally averaged temperature and at the {$\sim$}1\%\textendash 10\% level in globally averaged wind speeds. As a result, we find that observable quantities are also time-variable: the secondary eclipse depth can be variable at the 2\% level, the phase-curve amplitude can change by 1\%, the phase-curve offset can shift by 5\textdegree, and terminator-averaged wind speeds can vary by 2kms-1. Additionally, we calculate how the eastern and western limb-averaged wind speeds vary with incident stellar flux and the strength of an imposed drag that parameterizes Lorentz forces in partially ionized atmospheres. We find that the eastern limb is blueshifted in models over a wide range of equilibrium temperature and drag strength, while the western limb is only redshifted if equilibrium temperatures are 1500K and drag is weak. Lastly, we show that temporal variability may be observationally detectable in the infrared through secondary eclipse observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, phase-curve observations with future space telescopes (e.g., ARIEL), and/or Doppler wind speed measurements with high-resolution spectrographs.},

We have extended the existing scale of measuring intensity of volcanic eruptions based on Earth based observations to accommodate intense and extreme volcanic activity. The mass of a rocky planetary object is found to be related to the magnitude of the internal heat, occurrences of Large Igneous Provinces and the duration of major volcanic activity from relevant data available for the inner solar system. The internal heat magnitude may also decide the intensity of volcanism in these planetary objects. The time evolution of volcanism in Earth and Mars has probably influenced the origin of life and biological evolution in these planets.},

  abstract = {Io is the volcanically most active body in the Solar System and has a large surface heat flux. The geological activity is thought to be the result of tides raised by Jupiter, but it is not known whether the current tidal heat production is sufficiently high to generate the observed surface heat flow. Io's tidal heat comes from the orbital energy of the Io-Jupiter system (resulting in orbital acceleration), whereas dissipation of energy in Jupiter causes Io's orbital motion to decelerate. Here we report a determination of the tidal dissipation in Io and Jupiter through its effect on the orbital motions of the Galilean moons. Our results show that the rate of internal energy dissipation in Io (k2/Q = 0.015+/-0.003, where k2 is the Love number and Q is the quality factor) is in good agreement with the observed surface heat flow, and suggest that Io is close to thermal equilibrium. Dissipation in Jupiter (k2/Q = (1.102+/-0.203)\texttimes 10-5) is close to the upper bound of its average value expected from the long-term evolution of the system, and dissipation in extrasolar planets may be higher than presently assumed. The measured secular accelerations indicate that Io is evolving inwards, towards Jupiter, and that the three innermost Galilean moons (Io, Europa and Ganymede) are evolving out of the exact Laplace resonance.}

  abstract = {The characterization of geologic heterogeneity that affects flow and transport phenomena in the subsurface is essential for cost-effective and reliable decision-making in applications such as groundwater supply and contaminant cleanup. In the last decades, geostatistical inversion approaches have been widely used to tackle subsurface characterization problems and quantify their corresponding uncertainty. Some well-established geostatistical methods use models that assume gradually varying parameters. However, in many cases, the subsurface can often be better represented as consisting of a few relatively uniform geologic facies or zones with abrupt changes at their boundaries. We advance a Bayesian inversion approach with the gradient represented not through a Gaussian but a Laplace prior, also known as total variation prior, for the case that there are reasons to believe that discrete geologic structures with relatively homogeneous properties predominate in the subsurface but their number, locations, and shapes are unknown a priori. Structural parameters (or hyperparameters of the inversion scheme) are determined in a Bayesian framework by maximizing the marginal distribution of these parameters using an expectation-maximization approach; this allows proper weighting of prior versus data information and produces results with realistic uncertainty quantification. We present here three applications of the method: a time-varying extraction rate estimation at a well, a linear cross-well seismic tomography, and a nonlinear hydraulic tomography. These results are compared with those achieved in the classical geostatistical method and it is shown that the Bayesian inversion approach with total variation prior can be a useful tool to identify discrete geologic structures.},

These are events during which a planet occults the disk of another planet in the same system, imparting a small photometric signal as its thermal or reflected light is blocked. We focus on the planets in TRAPPIST-1, whose orbital planes we show are aligned to {$<$}0. 3 at 90\% confidence. We present a photodynamical model for predicting and computing PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 and other systems for various assumptions of the planets' atmospheric states. When marginalizing over the uncertainties on all orbital parameters, we find that the rate of PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 is about 1.4 per day. We investigate the prospects for detection of these events with the James Webb Space Telescope, finding that {$\sim$}10\textendash 20 occultations per year of b and c should be above the noise level at 12\textendash 15{$\mu$}m. Joint modeling of several of these PPOs could lead to a robust detection. Alternatively, observations with the proposed Origins Space Telescope should be able to detect individual PPOs at high signal-to-noise ratios. We show how PPOs can be used to break transit timing variation degeneracies, imposing strong constraints on the eccentricities and masses of the planets, as well as to constrain the longitudes of nodes and thus the complete three-dimensional structure of the system. We further show how modeling of these events can be used to reveal a planet's day/night temperature contrast and construct crude surface maps.

Using a spherical harmonic-based reflection model developed as an extension of the STARRY package, we are able to reconstruct the surface features of this rocky world. We recover a time-variable albedo map of the planet including persistent regions which we interpret as oceans and cloud banks indicative of continental features. We argue that this planet represents the most promising detection of a habitable world to date, although the potential intelligence of any life on it is yet to be determined.},

In principle, these light curves encode a vast amount of information about stellar variability and, in particular, the distribution of starspots and other features on their surfaces. Unfortunately, the problem of inferring stellar surface properties from a rotational light curve is famously ill-posed, as it often does not admit a unique solution. Inferences about the number, size, contrast, and location of spots can therefore depend very strongly on the assumptions of the model, the regularization scheme, or the prior. The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to explore the various degeneracies affecting the stellar light-curve "inversion" problem and their effect on what can and cannot be learned from a stellar surface, given unresolved photometric measurements, and (2) to motivate ensemble analyses of the light curves of many stars at once as a powerful data-driven alternative to common priors adopted in the literature. We further derive novel results on the dependence of the null space on stellar inclination and limb darkening and show that single-band photometric measurements cannot uniquely constrain quantities like the total spot coverage without the use of strong priors. This is the first in a series of papers devoted to the development of novel algorithms and tools for the analysis of stellar light curves and spectral time series, with the explicit goal of enabling statistically robust inferences about their surface properties.},

In particular, GPs excel at marginalization over the stellar signal when the variability due to starspots is treated as a nuisance, as in exoplanet transit modeling. However, these effective models are less useful in cases where the starspot signal is of primary interest, since it is not obvious how the parameters of the GP relate to physical parameters like the spot size, contrast, and latitudinal distribution. Instead, it is common practice to explicitly model the effect of individual starspots on the light curve and attempt to infer their properties via optimization or posterior inference. Unfortunately, this process is ill-posed and often computationally intractable when applied to stars with more than a few spots and/or to ensembles of many stars. Here we derive a closed-form expression for a GP that describes the light curve of a rotating, evolving stellar surface conditioned on a given distribution of starspot sizes, contrasts, and latitudes. We demonstrate that this model is correctly calibrated, allowing one to robustly infer physical parameters of interest from one or more light curves, including the typical spot radii and latitudes. Our GP has far-ranging implications for understanding the variability and magnetic activity of stars from light curves and radial velocity measurements, as well as for modeling correlated noise in exoplanet searches. Our implementation is efficient, user-friendly, and open-source, available in the package starry\_process.},

To assist community preparations for JWST observations, we use simulations of plausible post-ocean-loss and habitable environments for the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets, and test simulations of all bright object time-series spectroscopy modes and all Mid-Infrared Instrument photometry filters to determine optimal observing strategies for atmospheric detection and characterization using both transmission and emission observations. We find that transmission spectroscopy with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph Prism is optimal for detecting terrestrial, CO2-containing atmospheres, potentially in fewer than 10 transits for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, if they lack high-altitude aerosols. If the TRAPPIST-1 planets possess Venus-like H2SO4 aerosols, up to 12 times more transits may be required to detect an atmosphere. We present optimal instruments and observing modes for the detection of individual molecular species in a given terrestrial atmosphere and an observational strategy for discriminating between evolutionary states. We find that water may be prohibitively difficult to detect in both Venus-like and habitable atmospheres, due to its presence lower in the atmosphere where transmission spectra are less sensitive. Although the presence of biogenic O2 and O3 will be extremely challenging to detect, abiotically produced oxygen from past ocean loss may be detectable for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets via O2\textendash O2 collisionally induced absorption at 1.06 and 1.27 {$\mu$}m, or via NIR O3 features for the outer three planets.

In this study, we provide an analytic framework to interpret observed phase curves, geometric albedos, and polarization of giant planet atmospheres. We compute the observables for non-conservative Rayleigh scattering in homogeneous semi-infinite atmospheres using both scalar and vector formalisms. In addition, we compute phase curves and albedos for Lambertian, isotropic, and anisotropic scattering phase functions. We provide analytic expressions for geometric albedos and spherical albedos as a function of the scattering albedo for Rayleigh scattering in semi-infinite atmospheres. Given an observed geometric albedo our prescriptions can be used to estimate the underlying scattering albedo of the atmosphere, which in turn is indicative of the scattering and absorptive properties of the atmosphere. We also study the dependence of polarization in Rayleigh scattering atmospheres on the orbital parameters of the planet-star system, particularly on the orbital inclination. We show how the orbital inclination of non-transiting exoplanets can be constrained from their observed polarization parameters. We consolidate the formalism, solution techniques, and results from analytic models available in the literature, often scattered in various sources, and present a systematic procedure to compute albedos, phase curves, and polarization of reflected light.},

We develop two complementary techniques for deriving the two-dimensional planet intensity: regularized slice mapping and spherical harmonic mapping. Both techniques give similar derived intensity maps for the infrared dayside flux of the planet, while the spherical harmonic method can be extended to include phase variation data which better constrain the map. The longitudinal offset of the dayside hot spot is consistent with that found in prior studies, strengthening the claim of super-rotating winds, and eliminating the possibility of phase variations being caused by stellar variability. The latitude of the hot spot is within 12fdg5 (68\% confidence) of the planet's equator, confirming the predictions of general circulation models for hot Jupiters and indicative of a small planet obliquity.},

  abstract = {Ultra-short period (USP) planets are a class of low mass planets with periods shorter than one day. Their origin is still unknown, with photo-evaporation of mini-Neptunes and in-situ formation being the most credited hypotheses. Formation scenarios differ radically in the predicted composition of USP planets, it is therefore extremely important to increase the still limited sample of USP planets with precise and accurate mass and density measurements. We report here the characterization of an USP planet with a period of 0.28 days around K2-141 (EPIC 246393474), and the validation of an outer planet with a period of 7.7 days in a grazing transit configuration. We derived the radii of the planets from the K2 light curve and used high-precision radial velocities gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph for mass measurements. For K2-141b we thus inferred a radius of \$1.51\textbackslash pm0.05\textasciitilde R\_\textbackslash oplus\$ and a mass of \$5.08\textbackslash pm0.41\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash oplus\$, consistent with a rocky composition and lack of a thick atmosphere. K2-141c is likely a Neptune-like planet, although due to the grazing transits and the non-detection in the RV dataset, we were not able to put a strong constraint on its density. We also report the detection of secondary eclipses and phase curve variations for K2-141b. The phase variation can be modeled either by a planet with a geometric albedo of \$0.30 \textbackslash pm 0.06\$ in the Kepler bandpass, or by thermal emission from the surface of the planet at \$\textbackslash sim\$3000K. Only follow-up observations at longer wavelengths will allow us to distinguish between these two scenarios.},

  abstract = {The upcoming launch of the James Webb Space Telescope means that we will soon have the capability to characterize the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets. However, it is still unknown whether such planets orbiting close to M dwarf stars can retain their atmospheres, or whether high-energy irradiation from the star will strip the gaseous envelopes from these objects. We present a new method to detect an atmosphere on a synchronously rotating rocky exoplanet around a K/M dwarf, by using thermal emission during secondary eclipse to infer a high dayside albedo that could only be explained by bright clouds. Based on calculations for plausible surface conditions, we conclude that a high albedo could be unambiguously interpreted as a signal of an atmosphere for planets with substellar temperatures of Tsub=410\textendash 1250 K. This range corresponds to equilibrium temperatures of Teq=300\textendash 880 K. We compare the inferred albedos of eight possible planet surface compositions to cloud albedo calculations. We determine that a layer of clouds with optical depths greater than {$\tau$}=0.5\textendash 7, would have high enough albedos to be distinguishable from a bare rock surface. This method of detecting an atmosphere on a rocky planet is complementary to existing methods for detecting atmospheres, because it provides a way to detect atmospheres with pressures below 1bar (e.g., Mars), which are too tenuous to transport significant heat but thick enough to host high-albedo clouds.},

  abstract = {Planetary atmospheres are inherently 3D objects that can have strong gradients in latitude, longitude, and altitude. Secondary eclipse mapping is a powerful way to map the 3D distribution of the atmosphere, but the data can have large correlations and errors in the presence of photon and instrument noise. We develop a technique to mitigate the large uncertainties of eclipse maps by identifying a small number of dominant spectra to make them more tractable for individual analysis via atmospheric retrieval. We use the eigencurves method to infer a multiwavelength map of a planet from spectroscopic secondary eclipse light curves. We then apply a clustering algorithm to the planet map to identify several regions with similar emergent spectra. We combine the similar spectra together to construct an 'eigenspectrum' for each distinct region on the planetary map. We demonstrate how this approach could be used to isolate hot from cold regions and/or regions with different chemical compositions in observations of hot Jupiters with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that our method struggles to identify sharp edges in maps with sudden discontinuities, but generally can be used as a first step before a more physically motivated modelling approach to determine the primary features observed on the planet.},

These observations, performed at thermal wavelengths when Io is in daylight, have been carefully processed to improve the sharpness of the initial, diffraction-limited, images. The myopic deconvolution process used ( idac) achieved an angular resolution estimated to be 0.15 arcsec, corresponding to a spatial resolution of {$\sim$}570 km on Io's disc at the time of the observations. The final images show a number of bright features which have been compared with the Galileo/NIMS data, the only data set with a comparable resolution available for the anti-Jovian side of the satellite as well as its Jupiter-facing side. Our maps of the hot spot distribution are quite consistent with the Galileo data. The Jupiter-facing side is dominated by emission from Loki, which accounts for {$\sim$}25\% of the total hot spot emission from that side (and 45\% of that we were able to resolve and identify), although Loki was in a phase of decreasing activity (but not yet quiescent), as derived from ground-based monitoring observations. A few more hot sources are detected, including Pele-Pillan. The other hemisphere is characterized by a large number of moderately bright hot spots which are distributed around Bosphorus Regio. These preliminary observations fully demonstrate the capabilities of an AO system coupled with a thermal camera to monitor the volcanic activity of Io, in terms of morphology as well as thermal output. These monitoring capabilities will become especially important when the Galileo mission ends.}

Use of a new myopic deconvolution method, Myopic Iterative Step Preserving Algorithm (MISTRAL), especially designed for planetary objects, significantly improves the quality and the reliability of the reconstructed images. Using a simulation of artificial images of Io, we estimate the extent to which this algorithm is able to prevent noise amplification, to better restore sharp edges, and to preserve the initial photometry. Once this algorithm has been applied to our data and the solar-reflected background has been subtracted, we have 89 images of Io available for search and temporal survey of the hot spots over 4 years. In most cases, the data, acquired during two consecutive nights, provide an almost global view of the surface of Io. We identify 20 hot spots for which we determine the coordinates and the brightness at 3.8 {$\mu$}m (as a function of time). More than half of the hot spots were detected on all the images and were considered as persistent. Particular emphasis has been put on the brightest two hot spots, Loki and Pele, for which we obtain a center-to-limb variation curve (a cosine curve for Loki and a curve decreasing slightly faster than a cosine law for Pele with possible physical interpretations). The temporal variations of their activity have been derived over these 4 years and, for Loki, compared with the results of other ground-based surveys. The variability of the other, fainter, sources has also been derived but with less accuracy. We have also identified a few new hot spots, some of which are transient, such as a diffuse emission seen in September and November 1999 at the location of the upcoming Tvashtar outburst. The data are based on observations (58.F-1003, 63.S-0260, and 64.S-0661) collected at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile.},

  abstract = {We present in this Keck AO paper the first global high angular resolution observations of Io in three broadband near-infrared filters: Kc (2.3 \textmu m), Lp (3.8 \textmu m), and Ms (4.7 \textmu m). The Keck AO observations are composed of 13 data sets taken during short time intervals spanning 10 nights in December, 2001. The MISTRAL deconvolution process, which is specifically aimed for planetary images, was applied to each image. The spatial resolution achieved with those ground-based observations is 150, 240, and 300 km in the Kc, Lp, and Ms band, respectively, making them similar in quality to most of the distant observations of the Galileo/NIMS instrument. Eleven images per filter were selected and stitched together after being deprojected to build a cylindrical map of the entire surface of the satellite. In Kc-band, surface albedo features, such as paterae (R {$>$} 60 km) are easily identifiable. The Babbar region is characterized by extremely low albedo at 2.2 \textmu m, and shows an absorption band at 0.9 \textmu m in Galileo/SSI data. These suggest that this region is covered by dark silicate deposits, possibly made of orthopyroxene. In the Lp\textendash Ms (3\textendash 5 \textmu m) bands, the thermal emission from active centers is easily identified. We detected 26 hot spots in both broadband filters over the entire surface of the minor planet; two have never been seen active before, nine more are seen in the Ms band. We focused our study on the hot spots detected in both broadband filters. Using the measurements of their brightness, we derived the temperature and area covered by 100 brightness measurements. Loki displayed a relatively quiescent activity. Dazhbog, a new eruption detected by Galileo/NIMS in August 2001, is a major feature in our survey. We also point out the fading of Tvashtar volcanic activity after more than two years of energetic activity, and the presence of a hot, but small, active center at the location of Surt, possibly a remnant of its exceptional eruption detected in February 2001. Two new active centers, labeled F and V on our data, are detected. Using the best temperature and the surface area derived from the L and M band intensities, we calculated the thermal output of each active center. The most energetic hot spots are Loki and Dazhbog, representing respectively 36 and 19\% of the total output calculated from a temperature fit of all hot spots (20.6 \texttimes{} 1012 W). Based on the temperature derived from hot spots ({$\sim$}400 K), our measurement can unambiguously identify the contribution to the heat flux from the silicate portion of the surface. Because the entire surface was observed, no extrapolation was required to calculate that flux. It is also important to note that we measured the brightness of the individual hot spots when they were located close to the Central Meridian. This minimizes the line-of-sight effect which does not follow strictly a classical cosine law. Finally, we argue that despite the widespread volcanic activity detected, Io was relatively quiescent in December 2001, with a minimum mean total output of 0.4\textendash 1.2 W m-2. This output is at least a factor of two lower than those inferred from observations made at longer wavelengths and at different epochs.},

The fundamental property of any sampling theorem is the number of samples required to represent a band-limited signal. To represent exactly a signal on the sphere band-limited at L, all sampling theorems on the sphere require O(L\^2) samples. However, our sampling theorem requires less than half the number of samples of other equiangular sampling theorems on the sphere and an asymptotically identical, but smaller, number of samples than the Gauss-Legendre sampling theorem. The complexity of our algorithms scale as O(L\^3), however, the continual use of fast Fourier transforms reduces the constant prefactor associated with the asymptotic scaling considerably, resulting in algorithms that are fast. Furthermore, we do not require any precomputation and our algorithms apply to both scalar and spin functions on the sphere without any change in computational complexity or computation time. We make our implementation of these algorithms available publicly and perform numerical experiments demonstrating their speed and accuracy up to very high band-limits.

Our approach describes the observed scene as a mixture of components with compact spatial support and uniform spectra over their support. We present the algorithm to perform the matrix factorization and introduce constraints that are useful for optical images of stars and distinct stellar populations in galaxies, in particular symmetry and monotonicity with respect to the source peak position. We also derive the treatment of correlated noise and convolutions with band-dependent point spread functions, rendering our approach applicable to coadded images observed under variable seeing conditions. SCARLET thus yields a PSF-matched photometry measurement with an optimally chosen weight function given by the mean morphology in all available bands. We demonstrate the performance of SCARLET for deblending crowded extragalactic scenes and on an AGN jet -- host galaxy separation problem in deep 5-band imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Stategic Survey Program. Using simulations with prominent crowding we show that SCARLET yields superior results to the HSC-SDSS deblender for the recovery of total fluxes, colors, and morphologies. Due to its non-parametric nature, a conceptual limitation of SCARLET is its sensitivity to undetected sources or multiple stellar population within detected sources, but an iterative strategy that adds components at the location of significant residuals appears promising.

  abstract = {The Proximal Gradient Method (PGM) is a robust and efficient way to minimize the sum of a smooth convex function \$f\$ and a non-differentiable convex function \$r\$. It determines the sizes of gradient steps according to the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of \$f\$. For many problems in data analysis, the Lipschitz constants are expensive or impossible to compute analytically because they depend on details of the experimental setup and the noise properties of the data. Adaptive optimization methods like AdaGrad choose step sizes according to on-the-fly estimates of the Hessian of \$f\$. As quasi-Newton methods, they generally outperform first-order gradient methods like PGM and adjust step sizes iteratively and with low computational cost. We propose an iterative proximal quasi-Newton algorithm, AdaProx, that utilizes the adaptive schemes of Adam and its variants (AMSGrad, AdamX, PAdam) and works for arbitrary proxable penalty functions \$r\$. In test cases for Constrained Matrix Factorization we demonstrate the advantages of AdaProx in fidelity and performance over PGM, especially when factorization components are poorly balanced. The python implementation of the algorithm presented here is available as an open-source package at https://github.com/pmelchior/proxmin},

  abstract = {Geological activity is thought to be important for the origin of life and for maintaining planetary habitability. We show that transient sulfate aerosols could be a signature of exoplanet volcanism and therefore of a geologically active world. A detection of transient aerosols, if linked to volcanism, could thus aid in habitability evaluations of the exoplanet. On Earth, subduction-induced explosive eruptions inject SO2 directly into the stratosphere, leading to the formation of sulfate aerosols with lifetimes of months to years. We demonstrate that the rapid increase and gradual decrease in sulfate aerosol loading associated with these eruptions may be detectable in transit transmission spectra with future large-aperture telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), for a planetary system at a distance of 10 pc, assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, bulk composition, and size. Specifically, we find that a signal-to-noise ratio of 12.1 and 7.1 could be achieved with E-ELT (assuming photon-limited noise) for an Earth analogue orbiting a Sun-like star and M5V star, respectively, even without multiple transits binned together. We propose that the detection of this transient signal would strongly suggest an exoplanet volcanic eruption, if potential false positives such as dust storms or bolide impacts can be ruled out. Furthermore, because scenarios exist in which O2 can form abiotically in the absence of volcanic activity, a detection of transient aerosols that can be linked to volcanism, along with a detection of O2, would be a more robust biosignature than O2 alone.

We generated 2-D fractal surfaces with varying compositions onto which we individually threw 10,000 light rays. Using an approximate form of the Fresnel equations we measured how much of the incident light was reflected. Having repeated this algorithm on varying surface roughnesses we find the spherical albedo as a function of the Hurst exponent, the geochemical composition of the magma, and the wavelength. As a proof of concept, we used our model on Kepler-10b to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. We present the spherical albedo values produced from different lava compositions and multiple tests that can be applied to observational data in order to determine their characteristics. Currently, there is a strong degeneracy in the surface composition of AMOPs due to the large uncertainties in their measured spherical albedos. In spite of this, when applied to Kepler-10b we show that its high albedo could be caused by a moderately wavy ocean that is rich in oxidised metallic species such as FeO, \$\textbackslash rm Fe\_\{2\}O\_\{3\}\$, \$\textbackslash rm Fe\_\{3\}O\_\{4\}\$. This would imply that Kepler-10b is a coreless or near-coreless body.},

The function f may be nonconvex as long as it is convex in every argument, while the constraints g  need to be convex but not smooth. If f is smooth, the proposed Block-Simultaneous Direction Method of Multipliers (bSDMM) can be interpreted as a proximal analog to inexact coordinate descent methods under constraints. Unlike alternative approaches for joint solvers of multiple-constraint problems, we do not require linear operators L of a constraint function g\dh L \'A\TH{} to be invertible or linked between each other. bSDMM is well-suited for a range of optimization problems, in particular for data analysis, where f is the likelihood function of a model and L could be a transformation matrix describing e.g. finite differences or basis transforms. We apply bSDMM to the Non-negative Matrix Factorization task of a hyperspectral unmixing problem and demonstrate convergence and effectiveness of multiple constraints on both matrix factors. The algorithms are implemented in python and released as an open-source package.},

Here we use numerical simulations and comparison with the geologic record to explore a heat-pipe model in which volcanism dominates surface heat transport. These simulations indicate that a cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat sources over time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics. Consistent with model predictions, the geologic record shows rapid volcanic resurfacing, contractional deformation, a low geothermal gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a rapid decrease in heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The heat-pipe Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate tectonics.},

Here we show that cooling via volcanic heat pipes may explain these observations and provide a universal model of the way terrestrial bodies transition from a magma-ocean state into subsequent single-plate, stagnant-lid convection or plate tectonic phases. In the heat-pipe cooling mode, magma moves from a high melt-fraction asthenosphere through the lithosphere to erupt and cool at the surface via narrow channels. Despite high surface heat flow, the rapid volcanic resurfacing produces a thick, cold, and strong lithosphere which undergoes contractional strain forced by downward advection of the surface toward smaller radii. We hypothesize that heat-pipe cooling is the last significant endogenic resurfacing process experienced by most terrestrial bodies in the solar system, because subsequent stagnant-lid convection produces only weak tectonic deformation. Terrestrial exoplanets appreciably larger than Earth may remain in heat-pipe mode for much of the lifespan of a Sun-like star.},

We developed a method that can provide accurate astrometric data for natural satellites \textendash{} the mutual approximations. The method can be applied when any two satellites pass close by each other in the apparent sky plane. The fundamental parameter is the central instant t0 of the passage when the distances reach a minimum. We applied the method for the Galilean moons. All observations were made with a 0.6 m telescope with a narrow-band filter centred at 889 nm with width of 15 nm which attenuated Jupiter's scattered light. We obtained central instants for 14 mutual approximations observed in 2014\textendash 2015. We determined t0 with an average precision of 3.42 mas (10.43 km). For comparison, we also applied the method for 5 occultations in the 2009 mutual phenomena campaign and for 22 occultations in the 2014\textendash 2015 campaign. The comparisons of t0 determined by our method with the results from mutual phenomena show an agreement by less than 1{$\sigma$} error in t0, typically less than 10 mas.

We also reanalysed and updated results for 25 mutual events observed in the 2009 campaign. All telescopes were equipped with narrow-band filters centred at 889 nm with a width of 15 nm to eliminate the scattered light from Jupiter. The albedos' ratio was determined using images before and after each event. We simulated images of moons, umbra, and penumbra in the sky plane, and integrated their fluxes to compute albedos, simulate light curves and fit them to the observed ones using a chi-square fitting procedure. For that, we used the complete version of the Oren-Nayer reflectance model. The relative satellite positions mean uncertainty was 11.2 mas ( 35 km) and 10.1 mas ( 31 km) for the 2014-2015 and 2009 campaigns respectively. The simulated and observed ASCII light curve files are freely available in electronic form at the Natural Satellites DataBase (NSDB). The 40/25 mutual events from our 2014-2015/2009 campaigns represent a significant contribution of 17\%/15\% in comparison with the PHEMU campaigns lead by the IMCCE. Besides that, our result for the eclipse of Amalthea is only the 4th such measurement ever published after the three ones observed by the 2014-2015 international PHEMU campaign.

  abstract = {Thermal phase curves of exoplanet atmospheres have revealed temperature maps as a function of planetary longitude, often by sinusoidal decomposition of the phase curve. We construct a framework for describing two-dimensional temperature maps of exoplanets with mathematical basis functions derived for a fluid layer on a rotating, heated sphere with drag/friction, which are generalizations of spherical harmonics. These basis functions naturally produce physically-motivated temperature maps for exoplanets with few free parameters. We investigate best practices for applying this framework to temperature maps of hot Jupiters by splitting the problem into two parts: (1) we constrain the temperature map as a function of latitude by tuning the basis functions to reproduce general circulation model (GCM) outputs, since disk-integrated phase curve observations do not constrain this dimension; and (2) we infer the temperature maps of real hot Jupiters using original reductions of several Spitzer phase curves, which directly constrain the temperature variations with longitude. The resulting phase curves can be described with only three free parameters per bandpass -- an efficiency improvement over the usual five or so used to describe sinusoidal decompositions of phase curves. Upon obtaining the hemispherically averaged dayside and nightside temperatures, the standard approach would be to use zero-dimensional box models to infer the Bond albedo and redistribution efficiency. We elucidate the limitation of these box models by demonstrating that negative Bond albedos may be obtained due to a choice of boundary condition on the nightside temperature. We propose generalized definitions for the Bond albedo and heat redistribution efficiency for use with two-dimensional (2D) temperature maps. Open-source software called kelp is provided to efficiently compute these phase curves.},

We then compare how pure Na, SiO, or SiO2 atmospheres would impact future observations. The more volatile Na atmosphere is thickest followed by SiO and SiO2, as expected. Despite its low vapour pressure, we find that a SiO2 atmosphere is easier to observe via transit spectroscopy due to its greater scale height near the day\textendash night terminator and the planetary radial velocity and acceleration are very high, facilitating high dispersion spectroscopy. The special geometry that arises from very small orbits allows for a wide range of limb observations for K2-141b. After determining the magma ocean depth, we infer that the ocean circulation required for SiO steady-state flow is only 10-4 m s-1, while the equivalent return flow for Na is several orders of magnitude greater. This suggests that a steady-state Na atmosphere cannot be sustained and that the surface will evolve over time.},

For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.},

The remarkable consequence is that several exo-Io column densities are, on average, more than sufficient to provide the {$\sim$}1010{$\pm$}1 Na cm-2 required by the equivalent width of exoplanet transmission spectra. Furthermore, the benchmark observations of both Jupiter's extended ({$\sim$}1000 R J) Na exosphere and Jupiter's atmosphere in transmission spectroscopy yield similar Na column densities that are purely exogenic in nature. As a proof of concept, we fit the ``high-altitude'' Na at WASP-49b with an ionization-limited cloud similar to the observed Na profile about Io. Moving forward, we strongly encourage time-dependent ingress and egress monitoring along with spectroscopic searches for other volcanic volatiles.},

  abstract = {Adaptive importance sampling is a class of techniques for finding good proposal distributions for importance sampling. Often the proposal distributions are standard probability distributions whose parameters are adapted based on the mismatch between the current proposal and a target distribution. In this work, we present an implicit adaptive importance sampling method that applies to complicated distributions which are not available in closed form. The method iteratively matches the moments of a set of Monte Carlo draws to weighted moments based on importance weights. We apply the method to Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation and show that it performs better than many existing parametric adaptive importance sampling methods while being computationally inexpensive.},

  abstract = {A new variant `PMF' of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and {$\sigma$} is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and {$\sigma$} are of dimensions n \texttimes{} m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n \texttimes{} p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p \texttimes{} m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by {$\sigma$} is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

  abstract = {Over a large range of equilibrium temperatures, clouds shape the transmission spectrum of hot Jupiter atmospheres, yet their composition remains unknown. Recent observations show that the Kepler lightcurves of some hot Jupiters are asymmetric: for the hottest planets, the lightcurve peaks before secondary eclipse, whereas for planets cooler than {$\sim$}1900 K, it peaks after secondary eclipse. We use the thermal structure from 3D global circulation models to determine the expected cloud distribution and Kepler lightcurves of hot Jupiters. We demonstrate that the change from an optical lightcurve dominated by thermal emission to one dominated by scattering (reflection) naturally explains the observed trend from negative to positive offset. For the cool planets the presence of an asymmetry in the Kepler light curve is a telltale sign of the cloud composition, because each cloud species can produce an offset only over a narrow range of effective temperatures. By comparing our models and the observations, we show that the cloud composition of hot Jupiters likely varies with equilibrium temperature. We suggest that a transition occurs between silicate and manganese sulfide clouds at a temperature near 1600 K, analogous to the L/T transition on brown dwarfs. The cold trapping of cloud species below the photosphere naturally produces such a transition and predicts similar transitions for other condensates, including TiO. We predict that most hot Jupiters should have cloudy nightsides, that partial cloudiness should be common at the limb, and that the dayside hot spot should often be cloud-free.},

This was confirmed by numerous phase curve observations probing the longitudinal brightness variation of the atmosphere. Global circulation models, however, systematically underestimate the phase curve amplitude and overestimate the shift of its maximum. We use a global circulation model including non-grey radiative transfer and realistic gas and cloud opacities to systematically investigate how the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters varies with equilibrium temperature from 1000 to 2200K. We show that the heat transport is very efficient for cloudless planets cooler than 1600K and becomes less efficient at higher temperatures. When nightside clouds are present, the day-to-night heat transport becomes extremely inefficient, leading to a good match to the observed low nightside temperatures. The constancy of this low temperature is, however, due to the strong dependence of the radiative timescale with temperature. We further show that nightside clouds increase the phase curve amplitude and decreases the phase curve offset at the same time. This change is very sensitive to the cloud chemical composition and particle size, meaning that the diversity in observed phase curves can be explained by a diversity of nightside cloud properties. Finally, we show that phase curve parameters do not necessarily track the day/night contrast nor the shift of the hot spot on isobars, and propose solutions to to recover the true hot-spot shift and day/night contrast.},

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

In this article we provide a general framework for evaluation of inverse problems on the sphere, with a strong emphasis on flexibility and scalability. We consider flexibility with respect to the prior selection (regularization), the problem definition - specifically the problem formulation (constrained/unconstrained) and problem setting (analysis/synthesis) - and optimization adopted to solve the problem. We discuss and quantify the trade-offs between problem formulation and setting. Crucially, we consider the Bayesian interpretation of the unconstrained problem which, combined with recent developments in probability density theory, permits rapid, statistically principled uncertainty quantification (UQ) in the spherical setting. Linearity is exploited to significantly increase the computational efficiency of such UQ techniques, which in some cases are shown to permit analytic solutions. We showcase this reconstruction framework and UQ techniques on a variety of spherical inverse problems.

Comparison of high spatial resolution temperature measurements with observed daytime SO2 gas pressures on Io provides evidence for local cold trapping of SO2 frost on scales smaller than the 60 km resolution of the PPR data. We also calculated the power output from several hot spots and estimated total global heat flow to be about 2.0\textendash 2.6 Wm-2.

The Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC), a four-color (visible to near infrared) camera, obtained 17 sets of images. The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), a high-resolution panchromatic camera, obtained 190 images, including many of Io eclipsed by Jupiter. We present a complete view of the discrete point-like emission sources in all images obtained by these two instruments. We located 54 emission sources and determined their brightnesses. These observations, the first that observed individual Ionian volcanoes on short timescales of seconds to minutes, demonstrate that the volcanoes have stable brightnesses on these timescales. The active volcanoes Tvashtar (63N, 124W) and E. Girru (22N, 245W) were observed by both LORRI and MVIC, both in the near-infrared (NIR) and methane (CH4) filters. Tvashtar was additionally observed in the red filter, which allowed us to calculate a color temperature of approximately 1200 K. We found that, with some exceptions, most of the volcanoes frequently active during the Galileo era continued to be active during the New Horizons flyby. We found that none of the seven volcanoes observed by New Horizons multiple times over short timescales showed substantial changes on the order of seconds and only one, E. Girru exhibited substantial variation over minutes to days, increasing by 25\% in just over an hour and decreasing by a factor of 4 over 6 days. Observations of Tvashtar are consistent with a current eruption similar to previously observed eruptions and are more consistent with the thermal emission of a lava flow than the fire fountains inferred from the November 1999 observations. These data also present new puzzles regarding Ionian volcanism. Since there is no associated surface change or low albedo feature that could be identified nearby, the source of the emission from E. Girru is a mystery. Furthermore, the in-eclipse glows we observe over many paterae are likely to be gas emission from interaction with the magnetosphere, but the details of that process are not clear.},

  abstract = {Tidal heating is the major source of heat in the outer solar system. Because of its strong tidal interaction with Jupiter and the other Galilean satellites, Io is incredibly volcanically active. We use the directly measured volcanic activity level of Io's volcanoes as a proxy for surface heat flow and compare it to tidal heating model predictions. Volcanic activity is a better proxy for heat flow than simply the locations of volcanic constructs. We determine the volcanic activity level using three data sets: the Galileo Photopolarimeter Radiometer (PPR), Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), and New Horizons LEISA. We also present a systematic reanalysis of the Galileo NIMS observations to determine the 3.5 {$\mu$}m brightness of 51 active volcanoes. We find that potential differences in volcanic style between high and low latitudes make high-latitude observations unreliable for distinguishing between tidal heating models. Observations of Io's polar areas, such as those by Juno, are necessary to unambiguously understand Io's heat flow. However, all three of the data sets examined show a relative dearth of volcanic brightness near 180 W (anti-Jovian point) and the equator, and the only data set with good observations of the sub-Jovian point (LEISA) also shows a lack of volcanic brightness in that region. These observations are more consistent with the mantle-heating model than the asthenospheric-heating model. Furthermore, all three of the data sets are consistent with fourfold symmetry in longitude and peak heat flow at mid-latitudes, which best matches with the combined heating case of Tackley et al.},

As a first step in this direction, we simulate ingress/egress light curves for three bright eclipsing hot Jupiters and evaluate the degree to which parameterized photospheric emission models can be distinguished from each other with repeated, noisy eclipse measurements. We find that the photometric accuracy of Spitzer is insufficient to use this tool effectively. On the other hand, the level of photospheric details that could be probed with a few JWST eclipse measurements could greatly inform hot-Jupiter atmospheric modeling efforts. A JWST program focused on nonparametric eclipse map inversions for hot Jupiters should be actively considered.},

  abstract = {We present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of a hypothetical ``warm Jupiter'' planet, for a range of possible obliquities from 0\textdegree{} to 90\textdegree. We model a Jupiter-mass planet on a 10 day orbit around a Sun-like star, since this hypothetical planet sits at the boundary between planets for which we expect that tidal forces should have aligned their rotation axes with their orbital axes (i.e., ones with zero obliquity) and planets whose timescale for tidal alignment is longer than the typical age of an exoplanet system. In line with observational progress, which is pushing atmospheric characterization for planets on longer orbital periods, we calculate the observable signatures of obliquity for a transiting warm Jupiter: in orbital phase curves of thermal emission and in the hemispheric flux gradients that could be measured by eclipse mapping. For both of these predicted measurements, the signal that we would see depends strongly on our viewing geometry relative to the orientation of the planet's rotation axis, and we thoroughly identify the degeneracies that result. We compare these signals to the predicted sensitivities of current and future instruments and determine that the James Webb Space Telescope should be able to constrain the obliquities of nearby warm Jupiters to be small (if 10) or to directly measure them if significantly non-zero (30) using the technique of eclipse mapping. For a bright target and assuming photon-limited precision, this could be done with a single secondary eclipse observation.},

The thermal phase mapping problem has previously been solved analytically, with orthogonal maps (spherical harmonics) yielding orthogonal light curves (sinusoids). The eclipse mapping problem, let alone combined phase+eclipse mapping, does not lend itself to such a neat solution. Previous efforts have adopted either spherical harmonics or various ad hoc map parameterizations, none of which produce orthogonal light curves. We use principal component analysis to construct orthogonal ``eigencurves,'' which we then use to fit published 8 {$\mu$}m observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. This approach has a few advantages over previously used techniques: (1) the light curves can be precomputed, accelerating the fitting process, (2) the eigencurves are orthogonal to each other, reducing parameter correlations, and (3) the eigencurves are model-independent and are ranked in order of sensitivity. One notable result of our analysis is that eclipse-only mapping of HD 189733b is far more sensitive to the central concentration of dayside flux than to the eastward offset of that hot spot. Mapping can, in principle, suffer from degeneracies between spatial patterns and orbital parameters. Previous mapping efforts using these data have either assumed a circular orbit and precise inclination, or have been pessimistic about the prospects of eclipse mapping in the face of uncertain orbital parameters. We show that for HD 189733b the combined photometry and radial velocity are sufficiently precise to retire this concern. Lastly, we present the first map of brightness temperature, and we quantify the amplitude and longitude offset of the dayside hot spot.},

The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from the disks. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference differential imaging method, and the Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection algorithm) using synthetic circumstellar disks and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need of prior selection of references, NMF not only can detect fainter circumstellar disks but also better preserves their morphology and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope STIS coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with different methods and compare them, and NMF is able to extract some circumstellar materials inside the primary ring for the first time. In an appendix, we mathematically investigate the stability of NMF components during the iteration and the linearity of NMF modeling.},

  abstract = {To characterize circumstellar systems in high-contrast imaging, the fundamental step is to construct a best point-spread function (PSF) template for the noncircumstellar signals (i.e., starlight and speckles) and separate it from the observation. With existing PSF construction methods, the circumstellar signals (e.g., planets, circumstellar disks) are unavoidably altered by overfitting and/or self-subtraction, making forward modeling a necessity to recover these signals. We present a forward modeling-free solution to these problems with data imputation using sequential nonnegative matrix factorization (DI-sNMF), which first converts this signal separation problem to a "missing data" problem in statistics by flagging the regions that host circumstellar signals as missing data, then attributes PSF signals to these regions. We mathematically prove it to have negligible alteration to circumstellar signals when the imputation region is relatively small, which thus enables precise measurement of these circumstellar objects. We apply it to simulated point-source and circumstellar disk observations to demonstrate its proper recovery of them. We apply it to Gemini Planet Imager K1-band observations of the debris disk surrounding HR 4796A, finding a tentative trend that the dust is more forward scattering as the wavelength increases. We expect DI-sNMF to be applicable to other general scenarios where the separation of signals is needed.},

The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope observed Io during four Jupiter transit events to obtain medium resolution far-UV spectral images near the Ly{$\alpha$} wavelength of 121.6 nm. Jupiter's bright Ly{$\alpha$} dayglow provides a bright, mostly uniform background light source for opacity measurements, much like during a stellar occultation or transiting exoplanet event. Peaks in the photoabsorption cross-sections for sulfur dioxide occur near 122 nm, with resulting absorptions raising the altitude where a tangential line-of-sight opacity of {$\sim$}1 occurs. This method of measuring column densities along lines of sight above the limb uses detailed image simulations and complements Ly{$\alpha$} reflectance imaging and other methods for measuring Io's SO2 gas on the disk. Our reported near-terminator limb observations with STIS confirm the findings from previous Ly{$\alpha$} disk reflectance imaging that Io's polar SO2 density is an order of magnitude lower than found at the equator. We provide constraints for additional attenuation by atmospheric hydrogen atoms produced by charge exchange reactions between magnetospheric protons and Io's atmosphere. Searches for plume-related features provided no definitive enhancements within the signal quality, ruling out unusually high levels of activity for Pele and Tvashtar.},

We present the analysis of 35 observations of Amalthea and 19 observations of Thebe realized with the 1-m telescope at the Pic du Midi observatory during three nights in 2015, January and April. The images were reduced through an optimal process that includes image and spherical corrections using the Gaia-DR1 catalogue to provide the most accurate equatorial (RA, Dec.) positions. We compared the observed positions of both satellites with the theoretical positions from JPL JUP310 satellite ephemerides and from the IMCCE INPOP13c planetary ephemeris. The values of rms (O-C) in equatorial positions are {$\pm$}112 mas for the Amalthea observations, or 330 km at Jupiter, and {$\pm$}90 mas for the Thebe observations, or 270 km at Jupiter. Using the Gaia-DR1 catalogue allowed us to eliminate systematic errors due to the star references up to 120 mas, or 350 km at Jupiter, by comparison with the UCAC4 catalogue.},

Using CoRoT-7b as a working case, we explore the consequences on the phase-curve of a non tidal-locked rotation, with the presence/absence of an atmosphere, and for different values of the surface albedo. We then simulate future observations of the reflected light and thermal emission from CoRoT-7b with NIRSPEC-JWST and look for detectable signatures, such as time lag, of those peculiarities. We also study the possibility to retrieve the latitudinal surface temperature distribution from the observed SED. Results. We demonstrate that we should be able to constrain several parameters after observations of two orbits (42 h) thanks to the broad range of wavelengths accessible with JWST: i) the Bond albedo is retrieved to within {$\pm$}0.03 in most cases. ii) The lag effect allows us to retrieve the rotation period within 3 h of a non phase-locked planet, whose rotation would be half the orbital period; for longer period, the accuracy is reduced. iii) Any spin period shorter than a limit in the range 30\textendash 800 h, depending on the thickness of the thermal layer in the soil, would be detected. iv) The presence of a thick gray atmosphere with a pressure of one bar, and a specific opacity higher than 10-5 m-2 kg-1 is detectable. v) With spectra up to 4.5 {$\mu$}m, the latitudinal temperature profile can be retrieved to within 30 K with a risk of a totally wrong solution in 5\% of the cases. This last result is obtained for a signal-to-noise ratio around 5 per resel, which should be reached on Corot-7 after a total exposure time of {$\sim$}70 h with NIRSPEC and only three hours on a V = 8 star. Conclusions. We conclude that it should thus be possible to distinguish the reference situation of a lava ocean with phase-locking and no atmosphere from other cases. In addition, obtaining the surface temperature map and the albedo brings important constraints on the nature or the physical state of the soil of hot super-Earths.},

We used our method to derive astrometric positions from the light curves of the events. We developed an accurate photometric model of mutual occultations and eclipses, while correcting for the satellite albedos, Hapke's light scattering law, the phase effect, and the limb darkening. We processed 609 light curves, and we compared the observed positions of the satellites with the theoretical positions from IMCCE NOE-5-2010-GAL satellite ephemerides and INPOP13c planetary ephemeris. The standard deviation after fitting the light curve in equatorial positions is {$\pm$}24 mas, or 75 km at Jupiter. The rms (O-C) in equatorial positions is {$\pm$}50 mas, or 150 km at Jupiter.},

  abstract = {The 2015 New Horizons flyby has produced the first high-resolution maps of morphology and topography of Pluto and Charon, the most distant objects so mapped. Global integrated mosaics of Pluto were produced using both LORRI framing camera and MVIC line scan camera data, showing the best resolution data obtained for all areas of the illuminated surface, {$\sim$}78\% of the body. A unique feature of the Pluto imaging data set is the observation of terrains illuminated only by light scattered from atmospheric haze, allowing us to map terrains in the southern hemisphere that would otherwise have been in darkness. MVIC 4-color data were combined with the panchromatic map to produce full color global maps. Digital elevation models (DEMs) over {$\sim$}42\% of Pluto were produced using combinations of MVIC hemispheric scans and LORRI mosaics, from which slopes at scales of {$\sim$}1 km can be determined. Pluto can be divided into regions each with distinct topographic signatures, corresponding with major physiographic terrain types. Large areas of Pluto are comprised of low-relief moderately cratered plains units. Deeply pitted and glaciated plains east of Sputnik Planitia are elevated {$\sim$}0.7 km. The most dominant topographic feature on Pluto is the 1200-by-2000-km wide depression enclosing the bright Sputnik Planitia ice sheet, the surface of which is 2.5-to-3.5 km deep (relative to the rim) and {$\sim$}2 km deep relative to the mean radius. The partial ring of steep-sided massifs, several of which are more than 5 km high, along the western margins of Sputnik Planitia produce some of the locally highest and steepest relief on Pluto, with slopes of 40\textendash 50\textdegree. The second major topographic feature is a complex, eroded, ridge-trough system {$\sim$}300\textendash 400 km wide and at least 3200~km long extending north-to-south along the 155\textdegree{} meridian. This enormous structure has several kilometers of relief. It may predate the large impact event forming the basin, though some post-Sputnik Planitia deformation is evident. The large depressed, partially walled plain, Hyecho Palus, lies due southwest of Sputnik Planitia. Near the center of Hyecho Palus lie the circular constructional edifices Wright and Piccard Montes. Wright Mons rises 4.5 km above these plains, with a central depression {$\sim$}4.5 km deep, whereas Piccard Mons, best observed in haze-light, rises {$\sim$}5.5 km above the plains but has a bowl-shaped central depression {$\sim$}5.5 km below the plains for a total relief of up to 11 km, the greatest observed on Pluto. Both of these features are interpreted as constructional (volcanic?) in nature. Additional prominent topographic features include a 2\textendash 3 km high and {$\sim$}600 km wide dome centered on the illuminated IAU pole and the amoeboidal plateaus of ``bladed'' terrains in the equatorial region, which rise 2\textendash 5 km above local terrains and are the highest standing geologic units on the encounter hemisphere. The mean elevations in the integrated DEM for the two radio occultation areas are consistent with the 5\textendash 6 km difference in elevation as determined independently by the radio experiment, and a limb profile near the egress point confirms the presence of elevated bladed terrains in that area. Local relief of 3\textendash 5 km at massifs, troughs and pits supports conclusions that the icy shell of Pluto is relatively rigid. Numerous examples of topographic control of ice or frost deposition occur across Pluto, including the distinct coloration of the polar dome, the elevated terrains of eastern Tombaugh Regio, and along the ridge-trough system, where ridge tops and fossae rims are covered in different ices than at lower elevations. The topographic hypsogram of Pluto's encounter hemisphere is strongly bimodal due to the large Sputnik Planitia depression. Otherwise the topographic signature of Pluto is controlled by deviations from the otherwise dominant low plains, including elevated bladed terrain plateaus and the depressed volcanic province including Wright and Piccard Montes.},

  abstract = {The 2015 New Horizons flyby through the Pluto system produced the first high-resolution topographic maps of Pluto and Charon, the most distant objects so mapped. Global integrated mosaics of the illuminated surface of Pluto's large icy moon Charon have been produced using both framing camera and line scan camera data (including four-color images at up to 1.47 km pixel scales), showing the best resolution data at all areas of the surface. Digital elevation models (DEMs) with vertical precisions of up to {$\sim$}0.1 km were constructed for {$\sim$}40\% of Charon using stereo imagery. Local radii estimates for the surface were also determined from the cartographic control network solution for the LORRI framing camera data, which validate the stereo solutions. Charon is moderately cratered, the largest of which is {$\sim$}250-km across and {$\sim$}6 km deep. Charon has a topographic range over the observed hemisphere from lowest to highest of {$\sim$}19 km, the largest topographic amplitude of any mid-sized icy body (including Ceres) other than Iapetus. Unlike Saturn's icy moons whose topographic signature is dominated by global relaxation of topography and subsequent impact cratering, large-scale tectonics and regional resurfacing dominate Charon's topography. Most of Charon's encounter hemisphere north of the equator (Oz Terra) is broken into large polygonal blocks by a network of wide troughs with typically 3\textendash 6 km relief; the deepest of these occur near the illuminated pole and are up to 13 km deep with respect to the global mean radius, the deepest known surfaces on Charon. The edge of this terrain is defined by large tilted blocks sloping {$\sim$}5\textdegree{} or so, the crests of which rise to 5 or 6 km above Charon mean, the highest known points on Charon. The southern resurfaced plains, Vulcan Planitia, consist of rolling plains, locally fractured and pitted, that are depressed {$\sim$}1 km below the mean elevation of the disrupted northern terrains of Oz Terra that comprise much of the northern hemisphere (but {$\sim$}2\textendash 2.5 km below the surfaces of the blocks themselves). These plains roll downward gently to the south with a topographic range of {$\sim$}5 km. The outer margins of Vulcan Planitia along the boundary with Oz Terra form a 2-3-km-deep trough, suggesting viscous flow along the outer margins. Isolated massifs 2\textendash 4 km high, also flanked by annular moats, lie within the planitia itself. The plains may be formed from volcanic resurfacing of cryogenic fluids, but the tilted blocks along the outer margins and the isolated and tilted massifs within Vulcan Planitia also suggest that much of Charon has been broken into large blocks, some of which have been rotated and some of which have foundered into Charon's upper ``mantle'', now exposed as Vulcan Planitia, a history that may be most similar to the disrupted terrains of Ariel.},

These are essential tools on the march toward biosignature searches on potentially habitable planets. We explore a range of exoplanet atmospheric conditions and forecast the expected results with JWST. We take realistic CHIMERA models that match existing Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope results and simulate the spectra achievable with the JWST MIRI+NIRCam Guaranteed Time Observations survey, which includes observations of HD 189733 b, WASP-80 b, HAT-P-19 b, WASP-107 b, GJ 436 b, and HAT-P-26 b. We then retrieve atmospheric parameters from these spectra to estimate the precision to which the planets' atmospheric compositions can be measured. We find that emission spectra have well-constrained unimodal solutions but transmission spectra near 10\texttimes{} solar abundance and solar C/O ratios can suffer from bimodal solutions. Broad wavelength coverage as well as higher-precision data can resolve bimodal solutions and provide dramatically better atmospheric parameter constraints. We find that metallicities can be measured to within 20\%\textendash 170\%, which approaches the precisions on solar system planets, and C/O ratios can be constrained to {$\sim$}10\%\textendash 60\%, assuming that observers can leverage short wavelength data to select the correct solution from the bimodal posteriors. These compositional precisions are sufficient to validate or refute predictions from disk formation models on final atmospheric abundances as long as their history is not erased by planet evolution processes. We also show the extent to which eclipse mapping with JWST is possible on our brightest system HD 189733 b.},

  abstract = {JWST holds great promise in characterizing atmospheres of transiting exoplanets, potentially providing insights into Earth-sized planets within the habitable zones of M dwarf host stars if photon-limited performance can be achieved. Here, we discuss the systematic error sources that are expected to be present in grism time series observations with the NIRCam instrument. We find that pointing jitter and high gain antenna moves on top of the detectors' subpixel crosshatch patterns will produce relatively small variations (less than 6 parts per million, ppm). The time-dependent aperture losses due to thermal instabilities in the optics can also be kept to below 2 ppm. To achieve these low noise sources, it is important to employ a sufficiently large (more than 1.1 arcseconds) extraction aperture. Persistence due to charge trapping will have a minor (less than 3 ppm) effect on time series 20 minutes into an exposure and is expected to play a much smaller role than it does for the HST WFC3 detectors. We expect temperature fluctuations to be less than 3 ppm. In total, our estimated noise floor from known systematic error sources is only 9 ppm per visit. We do however urge caution as unknown systematic error sources could be present in flight and will only be measurable on astrophysical sources like quiescent stars. We find that reciprocity failure may introduce a perennial instrument offset at the 40 ppm level, so corrections may be needed when stitching together a multi-instrument multi-observatory spectrum over wide wavelength ranges.},

Compared to a mass-flux convection parameterization, a simplified convection adjustment parameterization leads to a {$>$}60\% decrease of the cloud albedo, increasing the mean dayside temperature by . The representation of convection also affects the atmospheric conditions of the night side, via a change in planetary-scale wave patterns. As a result, using the convection adjustment scheme makes the nightside cold traps warmer by 17\textendash 36 K for the planets in our simulations. The day\textendash night thermal contrast is sensitive to the representation of convection in 3D GCM simulations, so caution should be taken when interpreting emission phase curves. The choice of convection treatment, however, does not alter the simulated climate enough to result in a departure from habitable conditions, at least for the atmospheric composition and planetary parameters used in our study. The near-surface conditions both in the Trappist-1e and Proxima b cases remain temperate, allowing for an active water cycle. We further advance our analysis using high-resolution model experiments, in which atmospheric convection is simulated explicitly. Our results suggest that in a hypothetical global convection-permitting simulation, the surface temperature contrast would be higher than in the coarse-resolution simulations with parameterized convection. In other words, models with parameterized convection may overestimate the inter-hemispheric heat redistribution efficiency.},

Given the paucity of data on exoplanet atmospheres, our approach is to emphasize fundamental principles and insights gained from Solar-System studies that are likely to be generalizable to exoplanets. We begin by presenting the hierarchy of basic equations used in atmospheric dynamics, including the Navier-Stokes, primitive, shallow-water, and two-dimensional nondivergent models. We then survey key concepts in atmospheric dynamics, including the importance of planetary rotation, the concept of balance, and scaling arguments to show how turbulent interactions generally produce large-scale east-west banding on rotating planets. We next turn to issues specific to giant planets, including their expected interior and atmospheric thermal structures, the implications for their wind patterns, and mechanisms to pump their east-west jets. Hot Jupiter atmospheric dynamics are given particular attention, as these close-in planets have been the subject of most of the concrete developments in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. We then turn to the basic elements of circulation on terrestrial planets as inferred from Solar-System studies, including Hadley cells, jet streams, processes that govern the large-scale horizontal temperature contrasts, and climate, and we discuss how these insights may apply to terrestrial exoplanets. Although exoplanets surely possess a greater diversity of circulation regimes than seen on the planets in our Solar System, our guiding philosophy is that the multi-decade study of Solar-System planets reviewed here provides a foundation upon which our understanding of more exotic exoplanetary meteorology must build.},

Although these objects are all fluid, hydrogen worlds with stratified atmospheres overlying convective interiors, they exhibit an impressive diversity of atmospheric behavior. Hot Jupiters are strongly irradiated, and a wealth of observations constrain the day-night temperature differences, circulation, and cloudiness. The intense stellar irradiation, presumed tidal locking and modest rotation leads to a novel regime of strong day-night radiative forcing. Circulation models predict large day-night temperature differences, global-scale eddies, patchy clouds, and, in most cases, a~fast eastward jet at the equator\textemdash equatorial superrotation. The warm Jupiters lie farther from their stars and are not generally tidally locked, so they may exhibit a wide range of rotation rates, obliquities, and orbital eccentricities, which, along with the weaker irradiation, leads to circulation patterns and observable signatures predicted to differ substantially from hot Jupiters. Brown dwarfs are typically isolated, rapidly rotating worlds; they radiate enormous energy fluxes into space and convect vigorously in their interiors. Their atmospheres exhibit patchiness in clouds and temperature on regional to global scales\textemdash the result of modulation by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Despite the lack of irradiation, such circulations can be driven by interaction of the interior convection with the overlying atmosphere, as well as self-organization of patchiness due to cloud-dynamical-radiative feedbacks. Finally, irradiated brown dwarfs help to bridge the gap between these classes of objects, experiencing intense external irradiation as well as vigorous interior convection. Collectively, these diverse objects span over six orders of magnitude in intrinsic heat flux and incident stellar flux, and two orders of magnitude in rotation rate\textemdash thereby placing strong constraints on how the circulation of giant planets (broadly defined) depend on these parameters. A~hierarchy of modeling approaches have yielded major new insights into the dynamics governing these phenomena.},

Convergence is assessed rigorously with: (i) a highly-accurate pseudospectral model which has been explicitly verified to perform well under hot-Jupiter flow conditions and (ii) comparisons of the kinetic energy spectra, instantaneous (unaveraged) vorticity fields and temporal evolutions of the vorticity field from simulations which are numerically equatable. In the simulations, the (horizontal and vertical) resolutions, dissipation operator order and viscosity coefficient are varied with identical physical and initial setups. All of the simulations are compared against a fiducial, reference simulation at high horizontal resolution and dissipation order (T682 and \$\textbackslash nabla\^\{16\}\$, respectively) -- as well as against each other. Broadly, the reference solution features a dynamic, zonally (east-west) asymmetric jet with a copious amount of small-scale vortices and gravity waves. Here we show that simulations converge to the reference simulation only at T341 resolution and with \$\textbackslash nabla\^\{16\}\$ dissipation order. Below this resolution and order, simulations either do not converge or converge to unphysical solutions.

  abstract = {We perform an extensive study of numerical convergence for hot-Jupiter atmospheric flow solutions in simulations employing a setup commonly-used in extrasolar planet studies, a resting state thermally forced to a prescribed temperature distribution on a short time-scale at high altitudes. Convergence is assessed rigorously with: (i) a highly-accurate pseudospectral model which has been explicitly verified to perform well under hot-Jupiter flow conditions and (ii) comparisons of the kinetic energy spectra, instantaneous (unaveraged) vorticity fields and temporal evolutions of the vorticity field from simulations which are numerically equatable. In the simulations, the (horizontal and vertical) resolutions, dissipation operator order and viscosity coefficient are varied with identical physical and initial setups. All of the simulations are compared against a fiducial, reference simulation at high horizontal resolution and dissipation order (T682 and \$\textbackslash nabla\^\{16\}\$, respectively) -- as well as against each other. Broadly, the reference solution features a dynamic, zonally (east-west) asymmetric jet with a copious amount of small-scale vortices and gravity waves. Here we show that simulations converge to the reference simulation only at T341 resolution and with \$\textbackslash nabla\^\{16\}\$ dissipation order. Below this resolution and order, simulations either do not converge or converge to unphysical solutions. The general convergence behaviour is independent of the vertical range of the atmosphere modelled, from \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash! 2\textbackslash!\textbackslash times\textbackslash! 10\^\{-3\}\$ MPa to \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash! 2\textbackslash!\textbackslash times\textbackslash! 10\^1\$ MPa. Ramifications for current extrasolar planet atmosphere modelling and observations are discussed.},

  abstract = {On hot Jupiter exoplanets, strong horizontal and vertical winds should homogenize the abundances of the important absorbers CH4 and CO much faster than chemical reactions restore chemical equilibrium. This effect, typically neglected in general circulation models (GCMs), has been suggested to explain discrepancies between observed infrared light curves and those predicted by GCMs. On the nightsides of several hot Jupiters, GCMs predict outgoing fluxes that are too large, especially in the Spitzer4.5 {$\mu$}m band. We modified the SPARC/MITgcm to include disequilibrium abundances of CH4, CO, and H2O by assuming that the CH4/CO ratio is constant throughout the simulation domain. We ran simulations of hot Jupiter HD 189733b with eight CH4/CO ratios. In the more likely COdominated regime, we find temperature changes 50\textendash 100 K compared to the simulation for equilibrium chemistry across large regions. This effect is large enough to affect predicted emission spectra and should thus be included in GCMs of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures between 600 and 1300 K. We find that spectra in regions with strong methane absorption, including the Spitzer3.6 and 8 {$\mu$}m bands, are strongly impacted by disequilibrium abundances. We expect chemical quenching to result in much larger nightside fluxes in the 3.6 {$\mu$}m band, in stark contrast to observations. Meanwhile, we find almost no effect on predicted observations in the 4.5 {$\mu$}m band, because the changes in opacity due to CO and H2O offset each other. We thus conclude that disequilibrium carbon chemistry cannot explain the observed low nightside fluxes in the 4.5 {$\mu$}m band.},

We consider the energetics of accretion and core formation, the timescale of cooling and its dependence on viscosity and partial melting, thermal regulation via the temperature dependence of viscosity, and the melting curves of rock and iron components at the ultra-high pressures characteristic of super-earths. We find that the efficiency of kinetic energy deposition during accretion increases with planetary mass; considering the likely role of giant impacts and core formation, we find that super-earths probably complete their accretionary phase in an entirely molten state. Considerations of thermal regulation lead us to propose model temperature profiles of super-earths that are controlled by silicate melting. We estimate melting curves of iron and rock components up to the extreme pressures characteristic of super-earth interiors based on existing experimental and               ab initio               results and scaling laws. We construct super-earth thermal models by solving the equations of mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium, together with equations of state of rock and iron components.

The predictions are based on Monte Carlo simulations of the nearby population of stars, occurrence rates of planets derived from Kepler, and models for the photometric performance and sky coverage of the TESS cameras. We expect that TESS will find approximately 1700 transiting planets from 2 \textasciiacute{} 105 pre-selected target stars.

Additional planets larger than 2 R\AA{} can be detected around stars that are not among the pre-selected target stars, because TESS will also deliver full-frame images at a 30-minute cadence. The planet detections are accompanied by over 1000 astrophysical false positives. We discuss how TESS data and groundbased observations can be used to distinguish the false positives from genuine planets. We also discuss the prospects for follow-up observations to measure the masses and atmospheres of the TESS planets.},

We use pixel-level decorrelation to derive accurate transit and eclipse depths from the Spitzer data, and we perform an extensive error analysis. We focus on determining possible variability in the eclipse data, as was reported in Demory et al. 2016a. From the transit data, we determine updated orbital parameters, yielding T0 = 2455733.0037 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.0002, P = 0.7365454 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.0000003 days, i = 83.5 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 1.3 degrees, and \$R\_p\$ = 1.89 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.05 \$R\_\textbackslash oplus\$. Our transit results are consistent with a constant depth, and we conclude that they are not variable. We find a significant amount of variability between the eight eclipse observations, and confirm agreement with Demory et al. 2016a through a correlation analysis. We convert the eclipse measurements to brightness temperatures, and generate and discuss several heuristic models that explain the evolution of the planet's eclipse depth versus time. The eclipses are best modeled by a year-to-year variability model, but variability on shorter timescales cannot be ruled out. The derived range of brightness temperatures can be achieved by a dark planet with inefficient heat redistribution intermittently covered over a large fraction of the sub-stellar hemisphere by reflective grains, possibly indicating volcanic activity or cloud variability. This time-variable system should be observable with future space missions, both planned (JWST) and proposed (i.e. ARIEL).},

  abstract = {While Galileo and other missions, as well as ground-based observations, have taught us much about Io's frequent and diverse forms of volcanism, the stochastic nature of volcanic outbursts remains a poorly constrained phenomenon. Outbursts have been outliers in many Io observation campaigns since the 1980s (Veeder 1994; Stansberry 1997; Howell, de Kleer 2016), and we present another data-set with which to derive cases and statistics of volcanic outbursts. We define outbursts as a brightness greater than 80 GW/sr/micron above Io's background brightness, in the L' filter. Of 120 observations with NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRFT) 2016-2020, three definitive outbursts were identified on May 10, 2018; May 28, 2019; and June 25, 2019. On May 28 and June 25 of 2019, we observed Io in eclipse and throughout its occultation with the L' band (3.5 microns). On May 10, 2018, we observed Io in reflected sunlight using the K, L', and M bands. While the emission includes all of Io, we expect the outburst to dominate at these shorter infrared wavelengths. Fitting a single temperature blackbody to the measured emission suggests that this outburst is composed of localized silicate lava-flows with temperatures greater than 1,100 K over areas less than 30 km2. The locations of these three outbursts are consistent with several known active Ionian volcanoes, although the low spatial resolution does not allow us to determine the exact source. Images from Juno's instrument are used to constrain the afterglow location for the June 2019 outburst. Variations in volcanism on Io, particularly large outbursts, are the most plausible explanation for variations in Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurora. If outbursts are a major source of changes in Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurorae, our observations suggest such changes would have occurred in mid-2018 and mid-2019. We also present the time-series of Io's total eclipse brightness and Loki's brightness for the duration of this observation campaign. The outburst times do not correlate with Loki's periodic brightening events or any other pattern discernable in the time-series.}

The observations were conducted with non-sidereal tracking on Jupiter outside of the field of view to reduce the stray light subtraction uncertainty due to the close proximity of Jupiter. Their eclipsed luminosity was 10-6\textendash 10-7 of their uneclipsed brightness, which is low enough that this phenomenon has been undiscovered until now. In addition, Europa in eclipse was {$<$}1/10 of the others at 1.5 {$\mu$}m, a potential clue to the origin of the source of luminosity. Likewise, Ganymede observations were attempted at 3.6 {$\mu$}m by the Spitzer Space Telescope, but it was not detected, suggesting a significant wavelength dependence. It is still unknown why they are luminous even when in the Jovian shadow, but forward-scattered sunlight by hazes in the Jovian upper atmosphere is proposed as the most plausible candidate. If this is the case, observations of these Galilean satellites while eclipsed by the Jovian shadow provide us with a new technique to investigate the Jovian atmospheric composition. Investigating the transmission spectrum of Jupiter by this method is important for investigating the atmosphere of extrasolar giant planets by transit spectroscopy.},

Our intensity distribution model for the eclipsed/occulted satellite is based on the criterion that it simulates a rotational light curve that matches the ground-based light curve. Dichotomy in the scattering characteristics of the leading and trailing sides explains the basic shape of the rotational light curves of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In the case of Io, the albedo map (courtesy United States Geological Survey) along with global values of scattering parameters works well. Mean values of residuals in (O - C) along and perpendicular to the track are found to be -3.3 and -3.4 mas, respectively, compared to `L2' theory for the seven 2E1/2O1 events. The corresponding rms values are 8.7 and 7.8 mas, respectively. For the five 1E3/1O3 events, the along and perpendicular to the track mean residuals are 5.6 and 3.2 mas, respectively. The corresponding rms residuals are 6.8 and 10.5 mas, respectively. We compare the results using the chosen model (Model 1) with a uniform but limb-darkened disc (Model 2). The residuals with Model 2 of the 2E1/2O1 and 1E3/1O3 events indicate a bias along the satellite track. The extent and direction of bias are consistent with the shift of the light centre from the geometric centre. Results using Model 1, which intrinsically takes into account the intensity distribution, show no such bias.},

Observations of Io at M (4.8 {$\mu$}m), 8.7 {$\mu$}m, N (10 {$\mu$}m), and Q (20 {$\mu$}m) with the Infrared Telescope Facility presented here were collected during nine apparitions between 1983 and 1993. These measurements provide full longitudinal coverage as well as an eclipse observation and the detection of two outbursts. Reflected sunlight, passive thermal emission, and radiation from thermal anomalies all contribute to the observed flux densities. We find that a new thermophysical model is required to match all the data. Two key elements of this model are (1) a ``thermal reservoir'' unit which lowers daytime temperatures, and (2) the ``thermal pedestal effect'' which shifts to shorter wave-lengths the spectral emission due to the reradiation of solar energy absorbed by the thermal anomalies. The thermal anomalies are modeled with a total of 10 source components at five locations. Io's heat flow is the sum of the power from these components.},

  abstract = {We have examined thermal emission from 240 active or recently-active volcanic features on Io and quantified the magnitude and distribution of their volcanic heat flow during the Galileo epoch. We use spacecraft data and a geological map of Io to derive an estimate of the maximum possible contribution from small dark areas not detected as thermally active but which nevertheless appear to be sites of recent volcanic activity. We utilize a trend analysis to extrapolate from the smallest detectable volcanic heat sources to these smallest mapped dark areas. Including the additional heat from estimates for ``outburst'' eruptions and for a multitude of very small (``myriad'') hot spots, we account for {$\sim$}62\texttimes 1012W ({$\sim$}59{$\pm$}7\% of Io's total thermal emission). Loki Patera contributes, on average, 9.6\texttimes 1012W ({$\sim$}9.1{$\pm$}1\%). All dark paterae contribute 45.3\texttimes 1012W ({$\sim$}43{$\pm$}5\%). Although dark flow fields cover a much larger area than dark paterae, they contribute only 5.6\texttimes 1012W ({$\sim$}5.3{$\pm$}0.6\%). Bright paterae contribute {$\sim$}2.6\texttimes 1012W ({$\sim$}2.5{$\pm$}0.3\%). Outburst eruption phases and very small hot spots contribute no more than {$\sim$}4\% of Io's total thermal emission: this is probably a maximum value. About 50\% of Io's volcanic heat flow emanates from only 1.2\% of Io's surface. Of Io's heat flow, 41{$\pm$}7.0\% remains unaccounted for in terms of identified sources. Globally, volcanic heat flow is not uniformly distributed. Power output per unit surface area is slightly biased towards mid-latitudes, although there is a stronger bias toward the northern hemisphere when Loki Patera is included. There is a slight favoring of the northern hemisphere for outbursts where locations were well constrained. Globally, we find peaks in thermal emission at {$\sim$}315\textdegree W and {$\sim$}105\textdegree W (using 30\textdegree{} bins). There is a minimum in thermal emission at around 200\textdegree W (almost at the anti-jovian longitude) which is a significant regional difference. These peaks and troughs suggest a shift to the east from predicted global heat flow patterns resulting from tidal heating in an asthenosphere. Global volcanic heat flow is dominated by thermal emission from paterae, especially from Loki Patera (312\textdegree W, 12\textdegree N). Thermal emission from dark flows maximises between 165\textdegree W and 225\textdegree W. Finally, it is possible that a multitude of very small hot spots, smaller than the present angular resolution detection limits, and/or cooler, secondary volcanic processes involving sulphurous compounds, may be responsible for at least part of the heat flow that is not associated with known sources. Such activity should be sought out during the next mission to Io.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for intractable likelihoods, such as the exchange algorithm, require simulations of the sufficient statistics at every iteration of the Markov chain, which often result in expensive computations. Surrogate models for the likelihood function have been developed to accelerate inference algorithms in this context. However, these surrogate models tend to be relatively inflexible, and often provide a poor approximation to the true likelihood function. In this article, we propose the use of a warped, gradient-enhanced, Gaussian process surrogate model for the likelihood function, which jointly models the sample means and variances of the sufficient statistics, and uses warping functions to capture covariance nonstationarity in the input parameter space. We show that both the consideration of nonstationarity and the inclusion of gradient information can be leveraged to obtain a surrogate model that outperforms the conventional stationary Gaussian process surrogate model when making inference, particularly in regions where the likelihood function exhibits a phase transition. We also show that the proposed surrogate model can be used to improve the effective sample size per unit time when embedded in exact inferential algorithms. The utility of our approach in speeding up inferential algorithms is demonstrated on simulated and real-world data.},

More efficient sampling schemes on the sphere improve reconstruction fidelity by restricting the solution-space and also by improving sparsity in wavelet space.

This technique permits an observer to resolve the surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary atmosphere previously published by Cooper \& Showman. We find that observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC observations at 3.6{$\mu$}m of a single secondary eclipse should permit sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper \& Showman model of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a similarly robust detection.},

  abstract = {Io, discovered by Galileo Galilei on January 7-13, 1610, is the innermost of the four Galilean satellites of the planet Jupiter (Galilei, 1610). It is the most volcanically active object in the Solar System, as recognized by observations from six National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spacecraft: Voyager 1 (March 1979), Voyager 2 (July 1979), Hubble Space Telescope (1990-present), Galileo (1996-2001), Cassini (December 2000), and New Horizons (February 2007). The lack of impact craters on Io in any spacecraft images at any resolution attests to the high resurfacing rate (1 cm/yr) and the dominant role of active volcanism in shaping its surface. High-temperature hot spots detected by the Galileo Solid-State Imager (SSI), Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), and Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR) usually correlate with darkest materials on the surface, suggesting active volcanism. The Voyager flybys obtained complete coverage of Io's subjovian hemisphere at 500 m/pixel to 2 km/pixel, and most of the rest of the satellite at 5-20 km/pixel. Repeated Galileo flybys obtained complementary coverage of Io's antijovian hemisphere at 5 m/pixel to 1.4 km/pixel. Thus, the Voyager and Galileo data sets were merged to enable the characterization of the whole surface of the satellite at a consistent resolution. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) produced a set of four global mosaics of Io in visible wavelengths at a spatial resolution of 1 km/pixel, released in February 2006, which we have used as base maps for this new global geologic map. Much has been learned about Io's volcanism, tectonics, degradation, and interior since the Voyager flybys, primarily during and following the Galileo Mission at Jupiter (December 1995-September 2003), and the results have been summarized in books published after the end of the Galileo Mission. Our mapping incorporates this new understanding to assist in map unit definition and to provide a global synthesis of Io's geology.},
